10091617	0	0	Selegiline - induced postural hypotension in Parkinson ' s disease : a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal .
10091617	1	120	OBJECTIVES : The United Kingdom Parkinson ' s Disease Research Group ( UKPDRG ) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L - dopa compared with those taking L - dopa alone .
10091617	2	371	Recently , we found that therapy with selegiline and L - dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline .
10091617	3	542	This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure .
10091617	4	642	The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension .
10091617	5	941	METHODS : The cardiovascular responses to standing and head - up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn .
10091617	6	1099	RESULTS : Head - up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline , one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures .
10091617	7	1284	A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing .
10091617	8	1351	Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug .
10091617	9	1493	Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action .
10091617	10	1654	CONCLUSION : This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L - dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension .
10091617	11	1804	The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non - selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed .
1009330	0	0	Further studies on effects of irrigation solutions on rat bladders .
1009330	1	68	Further studies on the effects of certain irrigating fluids on the rat bladder for 18 hours are reported .
1009330	2	174	The results have shown that the degradation product p - choloroaniline is not a significant factor in chlorhexidine - digluconate associated erosive cystitis .
1009330	3	329	A high percentage of kanamycin - colistin and povidone - iodine irrigations were associated with erosive cystitis and suggested a possible complication with human usage .
1009330	4	495	Picloxydine irrigations appeared to have a lower incidence of erosive cystitis but further studies would have to be performed before it could be recommended for use in urological procedures .
10193204	0	0	Effects of tetrandrine and fangchinoline on experimental thrombosis in mice and human platelet aggregation .
10193204	1	108	Tetrandrine ( TET ) and fangchinoline ( FAN ) are two naturally occurring analogues with a bisbenzylisoquinoline structure .
10193204	2	228	The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of TET and FAN on the experimental thrombosis induced by collagen plus epinephrine ( EP ) in mice , and platelet aggregation and blood coagulation in vitro .
10193204	3	442	In the in vivo study , the administration ( 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) of TET and FAN in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55 % and 35 % , respectively , while acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA , 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) , a positive control , showed only 30 % inhibition .
10193204	4	687	In the vitro human platelet aggregations induced by the agonists used in tests , TET and FAN showed the inhibitions dose dependently .
10193204	5	820	In addition , neither TET nor FAN showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) and thrombin time ( TT ) using human - citrated plasma .
10193204	6	1037	These results suggest that antithrombosis of TET and FAN in mice may be mainly related to the antiplatelet aggregation activities .
10342929	0	0	Angioedema due to ACE inhibitors : common and inadequately diagnosed .
10342929	1	69	The estimated incidence of angioedema during angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor treatment is between 1 and 7 per thousand patients .
10342929	2	212	This potentially serious adverse effect is often preceded by minor manifestations that may serve as a warning .
10365197	0	0	Cocaine - induced mood disorder : prevalence rates and psychiatric symptoms in an outpatient cocaine - dependent sample .
10365197	1	116	This paper attempts to examine and compare prevalence rates and symptom patterns of DSM substance - induced and other mood disorders . 243 cocaine - dependent outpatients with cocaine - induced mood disorder ( CIMD ) , other mood disorders , or no mood disorder were compared on measures of psychiatric symptoms .
10365197	2	418	The prevalence rate for CIMD was 12 % at baseline .
10365197	3	468	Introduction of the DSM - IV diagnosis of CIMD did not substantially affect rates of the other depressive disorders .
10365197	4	583	Patients with CIMD had symptom severity levels between those of patients with and without a mood disorder .
10365197	5	690	These findings suggest some validity for the new DSM - IV diagnosis of CIMD , but also suggest that it requires further specification and replication .
10406016	0	0	Effect of fucoidan treatment on collagenase - induced intracerebral hemorrhage in rats .
10406016	1	86	Inflammatory cells are postulated to mediate some of the brain damage following ischemic stroke .
10406016	2	183	Intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with more inflammation than ischemic stroke .
10406016	3	267	We tested the sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan , which has been reported to reduce inflammatory brain damage , in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus .
10406016	4	491	Rats were treated with seven day intravenous infusion of fucoidan ( 30 micrograms h - 1 ) or vehicle .
10406016	5	589	The hematoma was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging .
10406016	6	654	Motor behavior , passive avoidance , and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks .
10406016	7	757	Fucoidan - treated rats exhibited evidence of impaired blood clotting and hemodilution , had larger hematomas , and tended to have less inflammation in the vicinity of the hematoma after three days .
10406016	8	952	They showed significantly more rapid improvement of motor function in the first week following hemorrhage and better memory retention in the passive avoidance test .
10406016	9	1117	Acute white matter edema and eventual neuronal loss in the striatum adjacent to the hematoma did not differ between the two groups .
10406016	10	1249	Investigation of more specific anti - inflammatory agents and hemodiluting agents are warranted in intracerebral hemorrhage .
10457883	0	0	Recurarization in the recovery room .
10457883	1	37	A case of recurarization in the recovery room is reported .
10457883	2	96	Accumulation of atracurium in the intravenous line led to recurarization after flushing the line in the recovery room .
10457883	3	215	A respiratory arrest with severe desaturation and bradycardia occurred .
10457883	4	287	Circumstances leading to this event and the mechanisms enabling a neuromuscular blockade to occur , following the administration of a small dose of relaxant , are discussed .
10520387	0	0	The haemodynamic effects of propofol in combination with ephedrine in elderly patients ( ASA groups 3 and 4 ) .
10520387	1	109	The marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of propofol are disadvantages in frail elderly patients .
10520387	2	220	We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of ephedrine to propofol in order to obtund the hypotensive response .
10520387	3	356	The haemodynamic effects of adding 15 , 20 or 25 mg of ephedrine to 200 mg of propofol were compared to control in 40 ASA 3 / 4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito - urinary surgery .
10520387	4	543	The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study .
10520387	5	698	However , marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients , occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients .
10520387	6	888	Due to the risk of this tachycardia inducing myocardial ischemia , we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the ephedrine / propofol / mixtures studied .
10526274	0	0	Gemcitabine plus vinorelbine in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma patients age 70 years or older or patients who cannot receive cisplatin .
10526274	1	134	Oncopaz Cooperative Group .
10526274	2	161	BACKGROUND : Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) is high among elderly patients , few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients .
10526274	3	371	Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine ( VNB ) or gemcitabine ( GEM ) may obtain a response rate of 20 - 30 % in elderly patients , with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life .
10526274	4	597	In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed .
10526274	5	792	METHODS : Forty - nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included , 38 of whom were age > / = 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin .
10526274	6	974	All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity .
10526274	7	1029	Treatment was comprised of VNB , 25 mg / m ( 2 ) , plus GEM , 1000 mg / m ( 2 ) , both on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 every 28 days .
10526274	8	1138	Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected .
10526274	9	1224	RESULTS : One hundred sixty - five courses were administered , with a median of 3 . 6 courses per patient .
10526274	10	1326	The overall response rate was 26 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 15 - 41 % ) .
10526274	11	1395	Two patients attained a complete response ( 4 % ) and 11 patients ( 22 % ) achieved a partial response .
10526274	12	1493	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35 % of those patients with an initial value > 0 , whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients ( 55 % ) .
10526274	13	1713	The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1 - year survival rate was 33 % .
10526274	14	1795	Toxicity was mild .
10526274	15	1814	Six patients ( 12 % ) had World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia , 2 patients ( 4 % ) had Grade 3 - 4 thrombocytopenia , and 2 patients ( 4 % ) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity .
10526274	16	1981	Three patients with severe neutropenia ( 6 % ) died of sepsis .
10526274	17	2041	The median age of those patients developing Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients ( 75 years vs . 72 years ; P = 0 . 047 ) .
10526274	18	2204	CONCLUSIONS : The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age > / = 75 years .
10526274	19	2325	This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression .
10526274	20	2383	Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte - colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment .
10526274	21	2497	New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC .
10579464	0	0	A selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonist , NRA0160 : a preclinical neuropharmacological profile .
10579464	1	98	NRA0160 , 5 - [ 2 - ( 4 - ( 3 - fluorobenzylidene ) piperidin - 1 - yl ) ethyl ] - 4 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) thiazole - 2 - carboxamide , has a high affinity for human cloned dopamine D4 . 2 , D4 . 4 and D4 . 7 receptors , with Ki values of 0 . 5 , 0 . 9 and 2 . 7 nM , respectively .
10579464	2	344	NRA0160 is over 20 , 000fold more potent at the dopamine D4 . 2 receptor compared with the human cloned dopamine D2L receptor .
10579464	3	467	NRA0160 has negligible affinity for the human cloned dopamine D3 receptor ( Ki = 39 nM ) , rat serotonin ( 5 - HT ) 2A receptors ( Ki = 180 nM ) and rat alpha1 adrenoceptor ( Ki = 237 nM ) .
10579464	4	639	NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized locomotor hyperactivity induced by methamphetamine ( MAP ) in mice .
10579464	5	739	NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized MAP - induced stereotyped behavior in mice , although their effects did not exceed 50 % inhibition , even at the highest dose given .
10579464	6	901	NRA0160 and clozapine significantly induced catalepsy in rats , although their effects did not exceed 50 % induction even at the highest dose given .
10579464	7	1048	NRA0160 and clozapine significantly reversed the disruption of prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) in rats produced by apomorphine .
10579464	8	1170	NRA0160 and clozapine significantly shortened the phencyclidine ( PCP ) - induced prolonged swimming latency in rats in a water maze task .
10579464	9	1305	These findings suggest that NRA0160 may have unique antipsychotic activities without the liability of motor side effects typical of classical antipsychotics .
10669626	0	0	Warfarin - induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin D .
10669626	1	78	The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma - carboxylation of matrix Gla protein , a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall .
10669626	2	393	The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin - treated rats .
10669626	3	523	Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20 - day - old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42 - day - old rats .
10669626	4	692	In contrast , no artery calcification could be detected in 10 - month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment .
10669626	5	816	To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin - induced artery calcification in animals of the same age , 20 - day - old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 - g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth .
10669626	6	1063	Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited group .
10669626	7	1292	Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30 % higher levels of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin - induced artery calcification , ie , the 10 - month - old rats and the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited young rats .
10669626	8	1777	This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin - induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels .
10669626	9	1925	The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification .
10669626	10	2041	High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days .
10669626	11	2147	High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week .
10669626	12	2317	In the current study , we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D - treated rats at 3 and 4 days .
10669626	13	2551	There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium , which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium .
10669626	14	2806	Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D , the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor .
10669626	15	3080	High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma - carboxylated .
10669626	16	3301	These observations indicate that although the gamma - carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor , they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites .
10683478	0	0	Test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in rodents .
10683478	1	71	These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug - induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents .
10683478	2	296	Apomorphine , a nonselective dopamine agonist , was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects , its ability to induce hypothermia , and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain .
10683478	3	504	From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine - induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed .
10683478	4	677	In rats , detection of apomorphine - induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions .
10683478	5	804	Moreover , test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug - induced hypothermia .
10683478	6	925	In mice , apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage .
10683478	7	1077	Drug - induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only , while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both .
10683478	8	1223	By contrast , apomorphine - induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box .
10683478	9	1316	Dopamine turnover ratios ( DOPAC : DA and HVA : DA ) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts .
10683478	10	1481	However , apomorphine - induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments .
10683478	11	1607	The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents .
10704919	0	0	Hemolysis of human erythrocytes induced by tamoxifen is related to disruption of membrane structure .
10704919	1	101	Tamoxifen ( TAM ) , the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer , induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia .
10704919	2	281	This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes , attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM - induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms .
10704919	3	506	TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration .
10704919	4	576	The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples , but 12 . 5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions .
10704919	5	712	Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis , TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes .
10704919	6	823	The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - T ) and alpha - tocopherol acetate ( alpha - TAc ) ( inactivated functional hydroxyl ) indicating that TAM - induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage .
10704919	7	1074	This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM - induced hemolysis .
10704919	8	1215	Furthermore , it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH , thus ruling out TAM - induced cell oxidative stress .
10704919	9	1369	Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K ( + ) from the cells , also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis , according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves .
10704919	10	1565	However , TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3 .
10704919	11	1692	Either alpha - T or alpha - TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes .
10704919	12	1796	These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided .
10704919	13	2014	Therefore , TAM - induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane .
10704919	14	2239	These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM , resulting in hemolytic anemia .
10704919	15	2375	Additionally , since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity , the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action .
10706004	0	0	Changes of sodium and ATP affinities of the cardiac ( Na , K ) - ATPase during and after nitric oxide deficient hypertension .
10706004	1	120	In the cardiovascular system , NO is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions .
10706004	2	210	Inhibition of NO synthesis induces sustained hypertension .
10706004	3	269	In several models of hypertension , elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue .
10706004	4	378	To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na + , we studied the response of cardiac ( Na , K ) - ATPase to NO - deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO - synthase inhibition with 40 mg / kg / day N ( G ) - nitro - L - arginine methyl ester ( L - NAME ) for 4 four weeks .
10706004	5	662	After 4 - week administration of L - NAME , the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) increased by 36 % .
10706004	6	753	Two weeks after terminating the treatment , the SBP recovered to control value .
10706004	7	832	When activating the ( Na , K ) - ATPase with its substrate ATP , no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in NO - deficient rats .
10706004	8	959	During activation with Na + , the Vmax remained unchanged , however the K ( Na ) increased by 50 % , indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the Na + - binding site in NO - deficient rats .
10706004	9	1145	After recovery from hypertension , the activity of ( Na , K ) - ATPase increased , due to higher affinity of the ATP - binding site , as revealed from the lowered Km value for ATP .
10706004	10	1315	The K ( Na ) value for Na + returned to control value .
10706004	11	1366	Inhibition of NO - synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed Na + - extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated Na + - binding properties of the ( Na , K ) - ATPase .
10706004	12	1562	After recovery of blood pressure to control values , the extrusion of Na + from cardiac cells was normalized , as revealed by restoration of the ( Na , K ) - ATPase activity .
10721819	0	0	Effects of long - term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats .
10721819	1	109	It has been shown that bromocriptine - induced tachycardia , which persisted after adrenalectomy , is ( i ) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and ( ii ) reduced by 5 - day isoproterenol pretreatment , supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart .
10721819	2	420	This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats .
10721819	3	573	Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate .
10721819	4	697	In control rats , intravenous bromocriptine ( 150 microg / kg ) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia .
10721819	5	805	Bromocriptine - induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment , while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia , an effect that was partly reduced by i . v . domperidone ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .
10721819	6	1011	Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment .
10721819	7	1097	In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol - pretreated rats , the isoproterenol - induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced , compared with saline - pretreated rats ( the EC50 of the isoproterenol - induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22 - fold ) .
10721819	8	1441	These results show that 15 - day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine - induced tachycardia to bradycardia , an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta - adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart .
10721819	9	1731	They suggest that , in normal conscious rats , the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2 receptors .
10737864	0	0	A developmental analysis of clonidine ' s effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats .
10737864	1	106	Under controlled conditions , infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha ( 2 ) adrenoceptor agonist , clonidine .
10737864	2	280	Previous investigations have determined that , in response to clonidine , ultrasound production increases through the 2nd - week postpartum and decreases thereafter .
10737864	3	442	Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern , and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia , we hypothesized that clonidine ' s developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other .
10737864	4	719	Therefore , in the present experiment , the effects of clonidine administration ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2 - , 8 - , 15 - , and 20 - day - old rats .
10737864	5	902	Age - related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables , including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine - induced bradycardia .
10737864	6	1069	This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by - product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine ' s detrimental effects on cardiovascular function .

10739826	1	83	The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) associated with newer oral contraceptives ( OC ) did not distinguish between patterns of OC use , namely first - time users , repeaters and switchers .
10739826	2	311	Data from a Transnational case - control study were used to assess the risk of VTE for the latter patterns of use , while accounting for duration of use .
10739826	3	462	Over the period 1993 - 1996 , 551 cases of VTE were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls .
10739826	4	570	Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns .
10739826	5	691	The adjusted rate ratio of VTE for repeat users of third generation OC was 0 . 6 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 3 - 1 . 2 ) relative to repeat users of second generation pills , whereas it was 1 . 3 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 7 - 2 . 4 ) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills .
10739826	6	989	We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of VTE when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills .
10739826	7	1216	These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer OC in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use .
10743446	0	0	Differential effects of systemically administered ketamine and lidocaine on dynamic and static hyperalgesia induced by intradermal capsaicin in humans .
10743446	1	152	We have examined the effect of systemic administration of ketamine and lidocaine on brush - evoked ( dynamic ) pain and punctate - evoked ( static ) hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin .
10743446	2	328	In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover study , we studied 12 volunteers in three experiments .
10743446	3	443	Capsaicin 100 micrograms was injected intradermally on the volar forearm followed by an i . v . infusion of ketamine ( bolus 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 over 10 min followed by infusion of 7 micrograms kg - 1 min - 1 ) , lidocaine 5 mg kg - 1 or saline for 50 min .
10743446	4	680	Infusion started 15 min after injection of capsaicin .
10743446	5	734	The following were measured : spontaneous pain , pain evoked by punctate and brush stimuli ( VAS ) , and areas of brush - evoked and punctate - evoked hyperalgesia .
10743446	6	890	Ketamine reduced both the area of brush - evoked and punctate - evoked hyperalgesia significantly and it tended to reduce brush - evoked pain .
10743446	7	1027	Lidocaine reduced the area of punctate - evoked hyperalgesia significantly .
10743446	8	1101	It tended to reduce VAS scores of spontaneous pain but had no effect on evoked pain .
10743446	9	1186	The differential effects of ketamine and lidocaine on static and dynamic hyperalgesia suggest that the two types of hyperalgesia are mediated by separate mechanisms and have a distinct pharmacology .
10791295	0	0	Development of apomorphine - induced aggressive behavior : comparison of adult male and female Wistar rats .
10791295	1	105	The development of apomorphine - induced ( 1 . 0 mg / kg s . c . once daily ) aggressive behavior of adult male and female Wistar rats obtained from the same breeder was studied in two consecutive sets .
10791295	2	297	In male animals , repeated apomorphine treatment induced a gradual development of aggressive behavior as evidenced by the increased intensity of aggressiveness and shortened latency before the first attack toward the opponent .
10791295	3	523	In female rats , only a weak tendency toward aggressiveness was found .
10791295	4	593	In conclusion , the present study demonstrates gender differences in the development of the apomorphine - induced aggressive behavior and indicates that the female rats do not fill the validation criteria for use in this method .
10807237	0	0	Intracranial aneurysms and cocaine abuse : analysis of prognostic indicators .
10807237	1	77	OBJECTIVE : The outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse is reportedly poor .
10807237	2	177	However , no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome .
10807237	3	306	METHODS : A review of admissions during a 6 - year period revealed 14 patients with cocaine - related aneurysms .
10807237	4	414	This group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with ruptured aneurysms and no history of cocaine abuse .
10807237	5	532	Age at presentation , time of ictus after intoxication , Hunt and Hess grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage , size of the aneurysm , location of the aneurysm , and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared .
10807237	6	747	RESULTS : The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group ( P < 0 . 002 ) .
10807237	7	867	In patients in the study group , all aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation .
10807237	8	955	The majority of these aneurysms were smaller than those of the control group ( 8 + / - 6 . 08 mm versus 11 + / - 5 . 4 mm ; P = 0 . 05 ) .
10807237	9	1080	The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant .
10807237	10	1168	Hunt and Hess grade ( P < 0 . 005 ) and age ( P < 0 . 007 ) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with cocaine - related aneurysms .
10807237	11	1308	CONCLUSION : Cocaine use predisposed aneurysmal rupture at a significantly earlier age and in much smaller aneurysms .
10807237	12	1425	Contrary to the published literature , this group did reasonably well with aggressive management .
10835440	0	0	Effect of intravenous nimodipine on blood pressure and outcome after acute stroke .
10835440	1	83	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : The Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial ( INWEST ) found a correlation between nimodipine - induced reduction in blood pressure ( BP ) and an unfavorable outcome in acute stroke .
10835440	2	294	We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction .
10835440	3	465	METHODS : Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke ( within 24 hours ) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo ( n = 100 ) , 1 mg / h ( low - dose ) nimodipine ( n = 101 ) , or 2 mg / h ( high - dose ) nimodipine ( n = 94 ) .
10835440	4	682	The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed .
10835440	5	788	RESULTS : Two hundred sixty - five patients were included in this analysis ( n = 92 , 93 , and 80 for placebo , low dose , and high dose , respectively ) .
10835440	6	931	Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP ( SBP ) and diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days .
10835440	7	1109	In multivariate analysis , a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high - dose group ( beta = 0 . 49 , P = 0 . 048 ) .
10835440	8	1280	Patients with a DBP reduction of > or = 20 % in the high - dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or dependency ( Barthel Index < 60 ) ( n / N = 25 / 26 , OR 10 . 16 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 to 101 . 74 ) and death alone ( n / N = 9 / 26 , OR 4 . 336 , 95 % CI 1 . 131 16 . 619 ) compared with all placebo patients ( n / N = 62 / 92 and 14 / 92 , respectively ) .
10835440	9	1638	There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome .
10835440	10	1695	CONCLUSIONS : DBP , but not SBP , reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high - dose nimodipine after acute stroke .
10835440	11	1860	For low - dose nimodipine , the results were not conclusive .
10835440	12	1918	These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine .
1085609	0	0	Neonatal pyridoxine responsive convulsions due to isoniazid therapy .
1085609	1	69	A 17 - day - old infant on isoniazid therapy 13 mg / kg daily from birth because of maternal tuberculosis was admitted after 4 days of clonic fits .
1085609	2	211	No underlying infective or biochemical cause could be found .
1085609	3	272	The fits ceased within 4 hours of administering intramuscular pyridoxine , suggesting an aetiology of pyridoxine deficiency secondary to isoniazid medication .
10901305	0	0	Ketamine sedation for the reduction of children ' s fractures in the emergency department .
10901305	1	89	BACKGROUND : There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of ketamine , a unique anesthetic , for emergency - department procedures requiring sedation .
10901305	2	247	The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children ' s fractures in the emergency department .
10901305	3	414	METHODS : One hundred and fourteen children ( average age , 5 . 3 years ; range , twelve months to ten years and ten months ) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level - I trauma center were prospectively evaluated .
10901305	4	687	Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously ( at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight ) in ninety - nine of the patients and intramuscularly ( at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight ) in the other fifteen .
10901305	5	931	A board - certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic , and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse .
10901305	6	1098	Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children ' s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS ) .
10901305	7	1263	RESULTS : The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty - six seconds ( range , twenty seconds to five minutes ) , and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty - two seconds ( range , sixty seconds to fifteen minutes ) .
10901305	8	1612	The average score according to the Children ' s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6 . 4 points ( range , 5 to 10 points ) , reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction .
10901305	9	1794	Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children .
10901305	10	1859	Ninety - nine percent ( sixty - eight ) of the sixty - nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation .
10901305	11	2039	Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients .
10901305	12	2129	Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable .
10901305	13	2176	Minor side effects included nausea ( thirteen patients ) , emesis ( eight of the thirteen patients with nausea ) , clumsiness ( evident as ataxic movements in ten patients ) , and dysphoric reaction ( one patient ) .
10901305	14	2381	No long - term sequelae were noted , and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares .
10901305	15	2465	CONCLUSIONS : Ketamine reliably , safely , and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children ' s fractures in the emergency department at our institution .
10901305	16	2656	Ketamine should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department , where proper one - on - one monitoring is used and board - certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient .
11007689	0	0	Cyclosporine and tacrolimus - associated thrombotic microangiopathy .
11007689	1	67	The development of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented .
11007689	2	185	Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange , plasma infusion , anticoagulation , and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion .
11007689	3	381	However , for recipients of organ transplantation , removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss .
11007689	4	542	The last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine .
11007689	5	703	As a result , switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine - induced TMA .
11007689	6	836	With the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation , tacrolimus - associated TMA has also been recognized .
11007689	7	965	However , literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of TMA in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited .
11007689	8	1110	We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine - induced TMA that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy .
11007689	9	1340	Introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of TMA and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft .
11007689	10	1491	Patients who are switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent TMA .
11027905	0	0	Analgesic effect of intravenous ketamine in cancer patients on morphine therapy : a randomized , controlled , double - blind , crossover , double - dose study .
11027905	1	151	Pain not responsive to morphine is often problematic .
11027905	2	205	Animal and clinical studies have suggested that N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonists , such as ketamine , may be effective in improving opioid analgesia in difficult pain syndromes , such as neuropathic pain .
11027905	3	414	A slow bolus of subhypnotic doses of ketamine ( 0 . 25 mg / kg or 0 . 50 mg / kg ) was given to 10 cancer patients whose pain was unrelieved by morphine in a randomized , double - blind , crossover , double - dose study .
11027905	4	618	Pain intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical scale ; nausea and vomiting , drowsiness , confusion , and dry mouth , using a scale from 0 to 3 ( not at all , slight , a lot , awful ) ; Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) ( 0 - 30 ) ; and arterial pressure were recorded before administration of drugs ( T0 ) and after 30 minutes ( T30 ) , 60 minutes ( T60 ) , 120 minutes ( T120 ) , and 180 minutes ( T180 ) .
11027905	5	991	Ketamine , but not saline solution , significantly reduced the pain intensity in almost all the patients at both doses .
11027905	6	1109	This effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses .
11027905	7	1178	Hallucinations occurred in 4 patients , and an unpleasant sensation ( " empty head " ) was also reported by 2 patients .
11027905	8	1293	These episodes reversed after the administration of diazepam 1 mg intravenously .
11027905	9	1374	Significant increases in drowsiness were reported in patients treated with ketamine in both groups and were more marked with ketamine 0 . 50 mg / kg .
11027905	10	1520	A significant difference in MMSE was observed at T30 in patients who received 0 . 50 mg / kg of ketamine .
11027905	11	1622	Ketamine can improve morphine analgesia in difficult pain syndromes , such as neuropathic pain .
11027905	12	1717	However , the occurrence of central adverse effects should be taken into account , especially when using higher doses .
11027905	13	1834	This observation should be tested in studies of prolonged ketamine administration .
11135224	0	0	Paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy within a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma .
11135224	1	156	BACKGROUND : Cisplatin - based chemotherapy combinations improve quality of life and survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) .
11135224	2	297	The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease .
11135224	3	411	METHODS : The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility , response rate , and toxicity of a paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine combination to treat metastatic NSCLC .
11135224	4	593	Thirty - five consecutive chemotherapy - naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 - 2 were treated with a combination of paclitaxel ( 135 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 3 hours ) on Day 1 , cisplatin ( 120 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 6 hours ) on Day 1 , and gemcitabine ( 800 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 30 minutes ) on Days 1 and 8 , every 4 weeks .
11135224	5	995	Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second - line chemotherapy after disease progression , the response and toxicity rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given .
11135224	6	1252	RESULTS : All the patients were examined for toxicity ; 34 were examinable for response .
11135224	7	1339	An objective response was observed in 73 . 5 % of the patients ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 55 . 6 - 87 . 1 % ) , including 4 complete responses ( 11 . 7 % ) .
11135224	8	1483	According to intention - to - treat , the overall response rate was 71 . 4 % ( 95 % CI , 53 . 7 - 85 . 4 % ) .
11135224	9	1575	After 154 courses of therapy , the median dose intensity was 131 mg / m ( 2 ) for paclitaxel ( 97 . 3 % ) , 117 mg / m ( 2 ) for cisplatin ( 97 . 3 % ) , and 1378 mg / m ( 2 ) for gemcitabine ( 86 . 2 % ) .
11135224	10	1748	World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39 . 9 % and 11 . 4 % of patients , respectively .
11135224	11	1872	There was one treatment - related death .
11135224	12	1911	Nonhematologic toxicities were mild .
11135224	13	1948	After a median follow - up of 22 months , the median progression free survival rate was 7 months , and the median survival time was 16 months .
11135224	14	2087	CONCLUSIONS : The combination of paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic NSCLC .
11135224	15	2221	This treatment merits further comparison with other cisplatin - based regimens .
11147747	0	0	Serotonergic antidepressants and urinary incontinence .
11147747	1	55	Many new serotonergic antidepressants have been introduced over the past decade .
11147747	2	136	Although urinary incontinence is listed as one side effect of these drugs in their package inserts there is only one report in the literature .
11147747	3	279	This concerns 2 male patients who experienced incontinence while taking venlafaxine .
11147747	4	364	In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed incontinence secondary to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and sertraline , as well as a third who developed this side effect on venlafaxine .
11147747	5	601	In 2 of the 3 cases the patients were also taking lithium carbonate and beta - blockers , both of which could have contributed to the incontinence .
11147747	6	746	Animal studies suggest that incontinence secondary to serotonergic antidepressants could be mediated by the 5HT4 receptors found on the bladder .
11147747	7	891	Further research is needed to delineate the frequency of this troubling side effect and how best to treat it .
11166519	0	0	Acute cocaine - induced seizures : differential sensitivity of six inbred mouse strains .
11166519	1	86	Mature male and female mice from six inbred stains were tested for susceptibility to behavioral seizures induced by a single injection of cocaine .
11166519	2	233	Cocaine was injected ip over a range of doses ( 50 - 100 mg / kg ) and behavior was monitored for 20 minutes .
11166519	3	337	Seizure end points included latency to forelimb or hindlimb clonus , latency to clonic running seizure and latency to jumping bouncing seizure .
11166519	4	480	A range of strain specific sensitivities was documented with A / J and SJL mice being most sensitive and C57BL / 6J most resistant .
11166519	5	608	DBA / 2J , BALB / cByJ and NZW / LacJ strains exhibited intermediate sensitivity .
11166519	6	683	EEG recordings were made in SJL , A / J and C57BL / 6J mice revealing a close correspondence between electrical activity and behavior .
11166519	7	813	Additionally , levels of cocaine determined in hippocampus and cortex were not different between sensitive and resistant strains .
11166519	8	942	Additional studies of these murine strains may be useful for investigating genetic influences on cocaine - induced seizures .
11198499	0	0	Hypotension following the initiation of tizanidine in a patient treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for chronic hypertension .
11198499	1	146	Centrally acting alpha - 2 adrenergic agonists are one of several pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of spasticity related to disorders of the central nervous system .
11198499	2	319	In addition to their effects on spasticity , certain adverse cardiorespiratory effects have been reported .
11198499	3	425	Adults chronically treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have a limited ability to respond to hypotension when the sympathetic response is simultaneously blocked .
11198499	4	608	The authors present a 10 - year - old boy chronically treated with lisinopril , an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor , to control hypertension who developed hypotension following the addition of tizanidine , an alpha - 2 agonist , for the treatment of spasticity .
11198499	5	868	The possible interaction of tizanidine and other antihypertensive agents should be kept in mind when prescribing therapy to treat either hypertension or spasticity in such patients .
11206082	0	0	Two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to beta - carboline - induced seizures are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other GABA ( A ) receptor ligands .
11206082	1	195	Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity ( BS line ) or resistance ( BR line ) to seizures induced by a single i . p . injection of methyl beta - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ( beta - CCM ) , an inverse agonist of the GABA ( A ) receptor benzodiazepine site .
11206082	2	460	Our aim was to characterize both lines ' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the GABA ( A ) receptor .
11206082	3	589	We measured diazepam - induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus - maze test , diazepam - induced sedation by recording the vigilance states , and picrotoxin - and pentylenetetrazol - induced seizures after i . p . injections .
11206082	4	802	Results presented here show that the differential sensitivities of BS and BR lines to beta - CCM can be extended to diazepam , picrotoxin , and pentylenetetrazol , suggesting a genetic selection of a general sensitivity and resistance to several ligands of the GABA ( A ) receptor .
11250767	0	0	Propylthiouracil - induced perinuclear - staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody - positive vasculitis in conjunction with pericarditis .
11250767	1	140	OBJECTIVE : To describe a case of propylthiouracil - induced vasculitis manifesting with pericarditis .
11250767	2	240	METHODS : We present the first case report of a woman with hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil in whom a syndrome of pericarditis , fever , and glomerulonephritis developed .
11250767	3	421	Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done , and a pericardial biopsy was performed .
11250767	4	514	RESULTS : A 25 - year - old woman with Graves ' disease had a febrile illness and evidence of pericarditis , which was confirmed by biopsy .
11250767	5	647	Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear - staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies ( pANCA ) against myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) .
11250767	6	795	Propylthiouracil therapy was withdrawn , and she was treated with a 1 - month course of prednisone , which alleviated her symptoms .
11250767	7	923	A literature review revealed no prior reports of pericarditis in anti - MPO pANCA - positive vasculitis associated with propylthio - uracil therapy .
11250767	8	1067	CONCLUSION : Pericarditis may be the initial manifestation of drug - induced vasculitis attributable to propylthio - uracil therapy .
11256525	0	0	Repeated transient anuria following losartan administration in a patient with a solitary kidney .
11256525	1	97	We report the case of a 70 - year - old hypertensive man with a solitary kidney and chronic renal insufficiency who developed two episodes of transient anuria after losartan administration .
11256525	2	283	He was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema , treated with high - dose diuretics .
11256525	3	387	Due to severe systolic dysfunction losartan was prescribed .
11256525	4	447	Surprisingly , the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria , which lasted eight hours despite high - dose furosemide and amine infusion .
11256525	5	600	One week later , by mistake , losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg , the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting 10 hours .
11256525	6	771	During these two episodes , his blood pressure diminished but no severe hypotension was noted .
11256525	7	865	Ultimately , an arteriography showed a 70 - 80 % renal artery stenosis .
11256525	8	933	In this patient , renal artery stenosis combined with heart failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin - angiotensin system ( RAS ) .
11256525	9	1102	Under such conditions , angiotensin II receptor blockade by losartan probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure .
11256525	10	1238	This case report highlights the fact that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with renovascular disease and should be used with extreme caution in this setting .
11263551	0	0	Calcineurin - inhibitor induced pain syndrome ( CIPS ) : a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation .
11263551	1	113	Bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases .
11263551	2	212	Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain .
11263551	3	278	Nine patients with severe pain in their feet , which was registered after transplantation , were investigated .
11263551	4	387	Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones .
11263551	5	451	Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones .
11263551	6	532	Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain , like reflex sympathetic dystrophy , polyneuropathy , Morton ' s neuralgia , gout , osteoporosis , avascular necrosis , intermittent claudication , orthopaedic foot deformities , stress fractures , and hyperparathyroidism .
11263551	7	803	The reduction of cyclosporine - or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain .
11263551	8	936	The Calcineurin - inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome ( CIPS ) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation , magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans .
11263551	9	1154	Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from CIPS .
11279304	0	0	Brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity .
11279304	1	82	Anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs , but they frequently cause dose - related cardiotoxicity .
11279304	2	188	The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction .
11279304	3	358	We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin ( DNR ) - containing regimen .
11279304	4	618	Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a DNR - containing regimen .
11279304	5	700	Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies .
11279304	6	786	The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography .
11279304	7	903	Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy .
11279304	8	991	Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy .
11279304	9	1094	The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit ( 40 pg / ml ) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography .
11279304	10	1318	On the other hand , BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given DNR , even at more than 700 mg / m ( 2 ) .
11279304	11	1438	The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure .
11279304	12	1551	These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity .
1130930	0	0	Nephrotoxicity of combined cephalothin - gentamicin regimen .
1130930	1	59	Two patients developed acute tubular necrosis , characterized clinically by acute oliguric renal failure , while they were receiving a combination of cephalothin sodium and gentamicin sulfate therapy .
1130930	2	258	Patients who are given this drug regimen should be observed very carefully for early signs of nephrotoxicity .
1130930	3	368	High doses of this antibiotic combination should be avoided especially in elderly patients .
1130930	4	460	Patients with renal insufficiency should not be given this regimen .
11334364	0	0	In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths during acetaminophen - induced nephrotoxicity , amiodarone - induced lung toxicity and doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity by a novel IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract .
11334364	1	250	Grape seed extract , primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins , has been shown to modulate a wide - range of biological , pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective .
11334364	2	442	This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract ( GSPE ) to prevent acetaminophen ( AAP ) - induced nephrotoxicity , amiodarone ( AMI ) - induced lung toxicity , and doxorubicin ( DOX ) - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .
11334364	3	675	Experimental design consisted of four groups : control ( vehicle alone ) , GSPE alone , drug alone and GSPE + drug .
11334364	4	784	For the cytoprotection study , animals were orally gavaged 100 mg / Kg GSPE for 7 - 10 days followed by i . p . injections of organ specific three drugs ( AAP : 500 mg / Kg for 24 h ; AMI : 50 mg / Kg / day for four days ; DOX : 20 mg / Kg for 48 h ) .
11334364	5	1013	Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA ( both endonuclease - dependent and independent ) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and / or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues .
11334364	6	1281	Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP , AMI and DOX , provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation .
11334364	7	1482	Histopathological examination of kidney , heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence .
11334364	8	1714	GSPE + drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery .
11334364	9	1796	Additionally , histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation .
11334364	10	1916	Interestingly , all the drugs , such as , AAP , AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE .
11334364	11	2089	Since AAP , AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo , the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and / or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals .
11334364	12	2305	In addition , its ' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute , which played a role in the chemoprevention process .
11334364	13	2447	Additionally , this may have been the first report on AMI - induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue .
11334364	14	2548	Taken together , these events undoubtedly establish GSPE ' s abundant bioavailability , and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo .
11379838	0	0	Antidepressant - induced mania in bipolar patients : identification of risk factors .
11379838	1	82	BACKGROUND : Concerns about possible risks of switching to mania associated with antidepressants continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for bipolar depression .
11379838	2	280	METHOD : The response of 44 patients meeting DSM - IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech - Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale .
11379838	3	516	Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age , sex , diagnosis ( DSM - IV bipolar I vs . bipolar II ) , number of previous manic episodes , type of antidepressant therapy used ( electroconvulsive therapy vs . antidepressant drugs and , more particularly , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ SSRIs ] ) , use and type of mood stabilizers ( lithium vs . anticonvulsants ) , and temperament of the patient , assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi - structured Affective Temperament Interview .
11379838	4	1110	RESULTS : Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27 % of all patients ( N = 12 ) ( and in 24 % of the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs [ 8 / 33 ] ) ; 16 % ( N = 7 ) experienced manic episodes , and 11 % ( N = 5 ) experienced hypomanic episodes .
11379838	5	1347	Sex , age , diagnosis ( bipolar I vs . bipolar II ) , and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching .
11379838	6	1458	The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer .
11379838	7	1595	In contrast , mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium ( 15 % , 4 / 26 ) than in patients not treated with lithium ( 44 % , 8 / 18 ; p = . 04 ) .
11379838	8	1747	The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching , whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching ( p = . 008 ) .
11379838	9	1994	CONCLUSION : The frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment .
11379838	10	2120	Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament , who have a greater risk of mood switches .
11391224	0	0	Peritubular capillary basement membrane reduplication in allografts and native kidney disease : a clinicopathologic study of 278 consecutive renal specimens .
11391224	1	157	BACKGROUND : An association has been found between transplant glomerulopathy ( TG ) and reduplication of peritubular capillary basement membranes ( PTCR ) .
11391224	2	308	Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance , only one prospective study has tried to confirm it .
11391224	3	433	METHODS : We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens ( from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys ) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR .
11391224	4	570	In addition to renal allografts with TG , we also examined grafts with acute rejection , recurrent glomerulonephritis , chronic allograft nephropathy and stable grafts ( " protocol biopsies " ) .
11391224	5	758	Native kidney specimens included a wide range of glomerulopathies as well as cases of thrombotic microangiopathy , malignant hypertension , acute interstitial nephritis , and acute tubular necrosis .
11391224	6	954	RESULTS : We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of TG , in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without TG , and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens .
11391224	7	1096	These 13 included cases of malignant hypertension , thrombotic microangiopathy , lupus nephritis , Henoch - Schonlein nephritis , crescentic glomerulonephritis , and cocaine - related acute renal failure .
11391224	8	1292	Mild PTCR in allografts without TG did not predict renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow - up periods of between 3 months and 1 year .
11391224	9	1440	CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that in transplants , there is a strong association between well - developed PTCR and TG , while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of TG is unclear .
11391224	10	1646	PTCR also occurs in certain native kidney diseases , though the association is not as strong as that for TG .
11391224	11	1754	We suggest that repeated endothelial injury , including immunologic injury , may be the cause of this lesion both in allografts and native kidneys .
11419773	0	0	Caffeine - induced cardiac arrhythmia : an unrecognised danger of healthfood products .
11419773	1	84	We describe a 25 - year - old woman with pre - existing mitral valve prolapse who developed intractable ventricular fibrillation after consuming a " natural energy " guarana health drink containing a high concentration of caffeine .
11419773	2	308	This case highlights the need for adequate labelling and regulation of such products .
11426838	0	0	Conformationally restricted analogs of BD1008 and an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting sigma1 receptors produce anti - cocaine effects in mice .
11426838	1	149	Cocaine ' s ability to interact with sigma receptors suggests that these proteins mediate some of its behavioral effects .
11426838	2	269	Therefore , three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice : BD1018 ( 3S - 1 - [ 2 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 4 . 3 . 0 ] nonane ) , BD1063 ( 1 - [ 2 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 4 - methylpiperazine ) , and LR132 ( 1R , 2S - ( + ) - cis - N - [ 2 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 2 - ( 1 - pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexylamine ) .
11426838	3	607	Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors .
11426838	4	715	The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine , opioid , GABA ( A ) and NMDA receptors .
11426838	5	865	In behavioral studies , pre - treatment of mice with BD1018 , BD1063 , or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine - induced convulsions and lethality .
11426838	6	1008	Moreover , post - treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine - induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals .
11426838	7	1120	In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists , the well - characterized sigma receptor agonist di - o - tolylguanidine ( DTG ) and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 ( 3R - 1 - [ 2 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 4 . 3 . 0 ] nonane ) each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine .
11426838	8	1421	At doses where alone , they produced no significant effects on locomotion , BD1018 , BD1063 and LR132 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine .
11426838	9	1591	To further validate the hypothesis that the anti - cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors , an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine .
11426838	10	1879	Together , the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of cocaine - induced behaviors .
11431197	0	0	Ranitidine - induced acute interstitial nephritis in a cadaveric renal allograft .
11431197	1	80	Ranitidine frequently is used for preventing peptic ulceration after renal transplantation .
11431197	2	172	This drug occasionally has been associated with acute interstitial nephritis in native kidneys .
11431197	3	268	There are no similar reports with renal transplantation .
11431197	4	325	We report a case of ranitidine - induced acute interstitial nephritis in a recipient of a cadaveric renal allograft presenting with acute allograft dysfunction within 48 hours of exposure to the drug .
11431197	5	524	The biopsy specimen showed pathognomonic features , including eosinophilic infiltration of the interstitial compartment .
11431197	6	644	Allograft function improved rapidly and returned to baseline after stopping the drug .
1147734	0	0	Liver disease caused by propylthiouracil .
1147734	1	42	This report presents the clinical , laboratory , and light and electron microscopic observations on a patient with chronic active ( aggressive ) hepatitis caused by the administration of propylthiouracil .
1147734	2	243	This is an addition to the list of drugs that must be considered in the evaluation of chronic liver disease .
11532387	0	0	Withdrawal - emergent rabbit syndrome during dose reduction of risperidone .
11532387	1	74	Rabbit syndrome ( RS ) is a rare extrapyramidal side effect caused by prolonged neuroleptic medication .
11532387	2	176	Here we present a case of withdrawal - emergent RS , which is the first of its kind to be reported .
11532387	3	273	The patient developed RS during dose reduction of risperidone .
11532387	4	336	The symptom was treated successfully with trihexyphenidyl anticholinergic therapy .
11532387	5	419	The underlying mechanism of withdrawal - emergent RS in the present case may have been related to the pharmacological profile of risperidone , a serotonin - dopamine antagonist , suggesting the pathophysiologic influence of the serotonin system in the development of RS .
11569530	0	0	Pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic assessment of the effects of E4031 , cisapride , terfenadine and terodiline on monophasic action potential duration in dog . 1 .
11569530	1	157	Torsades de pointes ( TDP ) is a potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia associated with increases in QT interval and monophasic action potential duration ( MAPD ) .
11569530	2	320	TDP is a side - effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market ( e . g . terfenadine and terodiline ) . 2 .
11569530	3	439	The potential of compounds to cause TDP was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog .
11569530	4	537	Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause TDP were investigated : terfenadine , terodiline , cisapride and E4031 .
11569530	5	661	On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target , free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures in man .
11569530	6	854	Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target - free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds . 3 .
11569530	7	1089	These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for terfenadine ( 1 . 9 nM ) , terodiline ( 76 nM ) , cisapride ( 11 nM ) and E4031 ( 1 . 9 nM ) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects .
11569530	8	1294	For compounds that have shown TDP in the clinic ( terfenadine , terodiline , cisapride ) there is little differentiation between the dog ED50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations in man ( < 10 - fold ) reflecting their limited safety margins .
11569530	9	1539	These data underline the need to maximize the therapeutic ratio with respect to TDP in potential development candidates and the importance of using free drug concentrations in pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic studies .
11581460	0	0	Bladder retention of urine as a result of continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl : 2 case reports .
11581460	1	103	Sedation has been commonly used in the neonate to decrease the stress and pain from the noxious stimuli and invasive procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit , as well as to facilitate synchrony between ventilator and spontaneous breaths .
11581460	2	347	Fentanyl , an opioid analgesic , is frequently used in the neonatal intensive care unit setting for these very purposes .
11581460	3	466	Various reported side effects of fentanyl administration include chest wall rigidity , hypotension , respiratory depression , and bradycardia .
11581460	4	606	Here , 2 cases of urinary bladder retention leading to renal pelvocalyceal dilatation mimicking hydronephrosis as a result of continuous infusion of fentanyl are reported .
11587867	0	0	Fatal myeloencephalopathy due to accidental intrathecal vincristin administration : a report of two cases .
11587867	1	106	We report on two fatal cases of accidental intrathecal vincristine instillation in a 5 - year old girl with recurrent acute lymphoblastic leucemia and a 57 - year old man with lymphoblastic lymphoma .
11587867	2	302	The girl died seven days , the man four weeks after intrathecal injection of vincristine .
11587867	3	391	Clinically , the onset was characterized by the signs of opistothonus , sensory and motor dysfunction and ascending paralysis .
11587867	4	516	Histological and immunohistochemical investigations ( HE - LFB , CD - 68 , Neurofilament ) revealed degeneration of myelin and axons as well as pseudocystic transformation in areas exposed to vincristine , accompanied by secondary changes with numerous prominent macrophages .
11587867	5	783	The clinical course and histopathological results of the two cases are presented .
11587867	6	865	A review of all reported cases in the literature is given .
11587867	7	924	A better controlled regimen for administering vincristine and intrathecal chemotherapy is recommended .
11642480	0	0	Palpebral twitching in a depressed adolescent on citalopram .
11642480	1	61	Current estimates suggest that between 0 . 4 % and 8 . 3 % of children and adolescents are affected by major depression .
11642480	2	176	We report a favorable response to treatment with citalopram by a 15 - year - old boy with major depression who exhibited palpebral twitching during his first 2 weeks of treatment .
11642480	3	352	This may have been a side effect of citalopram as it remitted with redistribution of doses .
11672959	0	0	The 3 - week sulphasalazine syndrome strikes again .
11672959	1	50	A 34 - year - old lady developed a constellation of dermatitis , fever , lymphadenopathy and hepatitis , beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral sulphasalazine for sero - negative rheumatoid arthritis .
11672959	2	249	Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis , associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates , without viral inclusion bodies , suggestive of an adverse drug reaction . A week later , fulminant drug - induced hepatitis , associated with the presence of anti - nuclear autoantibodies ( but not with other markers of autoimmunity ) , and accompanied by multi - organ failure and sepsis , supervened .
11672959	3	712	She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy . Post - mortem examination showed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis , acute hypersensitivity myocarditis , focal acute tubulo - interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow necrosis , with no evidence of malignancy .
11672959	4	1012	It is thought that the clinico - pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so - called " 3 - week sulphasalazine syndrome " , a rare , but often fatal , immunoallergic reaction to sulphasalazine .
11679859	0	0	Intravenous administration of prochlorperazine by 15 - minute infusion versus 2 - minute bolus does not affect the incidence of akathisia : a prospective , randomized , controlled trial .
11679859	1	180	STUDY OBJECTIVE : We sought to compare the rate of akathisia after administration of intravenous prochlorperazine as a 2 - minute bolus or 15 - minute infusion .
11679859	2	336	METHODS : We conducted a prospective , randomized , double - blind study in the emergency department of a central - city teaching hospital .
11679859	3	469	Patients aged 18 years or older treated with prochlorperazine for headache , nausea , or vomiting were eligible for inclusion .
11679859	4	594	Study participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of prochlorperazine administered intravenously by means of 2 - minute push ( bolus group ) or 10 mg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline solution administered by means of intravenous infusion during a 15 - minute period ( infusion group ) .
11679859	5	875	The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing akathisia within 60 minutes of administration .
11679859	6	989	Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or agitation or a change of 2 or more in the patient - reported akathisia rating scale and a change of at least 1 in the investigator - observed akathisia rating scale .
11679859	7	1223	The intensity of headache and nausea was measured with a 100 - mm visual analog scale .
11679859	8	1308	RESULTS : One hundred patients were enrolled .
11679859	9	1353	One study participant was excluded after protocol violation .
11679859	10	1414	Seventy - three percent ( 73 / 99 ) of the study participants were treated for headache and 70 % ( 70 / 99 ) for nausea .
11679859	11	1524	In the bolus group , 26 . 0 % ( 13 / 50 ) had akathisia compared with 32 . 7 % ( 16 / 49 ) in the infusion group ( Delta = - 6 . 7 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] - 24 . 6 % to 11 . 2 % ) .
11679859	12	1683	The difference between the bolus and infusion groups in the percentage of participants who saw a 50 % reduction in their headache intensity within 30 minutes was 11 . 8 % ( 95 % CI - 9 . 6 % to 33 . 3 % ) .
11679859	13	1875	The difference in the percentage of patients with a 50 % reduction in their nausea was 12 . 6 % ( 95 % CI - 4 . 6 % to 29 . 8 % ) .
11679859	14	1992	CONCLUSION : A 50 % reduction in the incidence of akathisia when prochlorperazine was administered by means of 15 - minute intravenous infusion versus a 2 - minute intravenous push was not detected .
11679859	15	2185	The efficacy of prochlorperazine in the treatment of headache and nausea likewise did not appear to be affected by the rate of administration , although no formal statistical comparisons were made .
11706060	0	0	Combined antiretroviral therapy causes cardiomyopathy and elevates plasma lactate in transgenic AIDS mice .
11706060	1	107	Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) is implicated in cardiomyopathy ( CM ) and in elevated plasma lactate ( LA ) in AIDS through mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction .
11706060	2	282	To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo , 8 - week - old hemizygous transgenic AIDS mice ( NL4 - 3Delta gag / pol ; TG ) and wild - type FVB / n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of zidovudine , lamivudine , and indinavir or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days .
11706060	3	560	At termination of the experiments , mice underwent echocardiography , quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of CM ( ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ ANF ] and sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase [ SERCA2 ] ) , and determination of plasma LA .
11706060	4	815	Myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy .
11706060	5	943	After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort , left ventricular mass increased 160 % by echocardiography .
11706060	6	1041	Molecularly , ANF mRNA increased 250 % and SERCA2 mRNA decreased 57 % .
11706060	7	1109	Biochemically , LA was elevated ( 8 . 5 + / - 2 . 0 mM ) .
11706060	8	1158	Pathologically , granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes , indicating enlarged , damaged mitochondria .
11706060	9	1278	Findings were confirmed ultrastructurally .
11706060	10	1321	No changes were found in other cohorts .
11706060	11	1361	After 10 days , only ANF was elevated , and only in the TG + HAART cohort .
11706060	12	1434	Results show that cumulative HAART caused mitochondrial CM with elevated LA in AIDS transgenic mice .
11745184	0	0	A Phase II trial of cisplatin plus WR - 2721 ( amifostine ) for metastatic breast carcinoma : an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study ( E8188 ) .
11745184	1	142	BACKGROUND : Cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second - or third - line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma .
11745184	2	272	Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8 % when 60 - 120 mg / m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3 - 4 weeks .
11745184	3	391	Although a dose - response effect has been observed with cisplatin , the dose - limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin ( e . g . , nephrotoxicity , ototoxicity , and neurotoxicity ) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma .
11745184	4	625	WR - 2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war .
11745184	5	730	Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy .
11745184	6	909	Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity , ototoxicity , and neuropathy were reduced .
11745184	7	1076	METHODS : A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one , but not more than one , chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease .
11745184	8	1311	Patients received amifostine , 910 mg / m2 intravenously over 15 minutes .
11745184	9	1382	After completion of the amifostine infusion , cisplatin 120 mg / m2 was administered over 30 minutes .
11745184	10	1481	Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin .
11745184	11	1561	Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression .
11745184	12	1629	RESULTS : Forty - four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 ( 16 % ) were ineligible .
11745184	13	1719	A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients .
11745184	14	1797	Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16 % .
11745184	15	1870	Most patients ( 57 % ) stopped treatment because of disease progression .
11745184	16	1940	Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52 % of patients .
11745184	17	1993	Seven different life - threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment .
11745184	18	2090	CONCLUSIONS : The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16 % .
11745184	19	2206	Neither a tumor - protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this trial .
11752354	0	0	Oral contraceptives and the risk of myocardial infarction .
11752354	1	59	BACKGROUND : An association between the use of oral contraceptives and the risk of myocardial infarction has been found in some , but not all , studies .
11752354	2	209	We investigated this association , according to the type of progestagen included in third - generation ( i . e . , desogestrel or gestodene ) and second - generation ( i . e . , levonorgestrel ) oral contraceptives , the dose of estrogen , and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS : In a nationwide , population - based , case - control study , we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first myocardial infarction between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a myocardial infarction and who were matched for age , calendar year of the index event , and area of residence .
11752354	3	826	Subjects supplied information on oral - contraceptive use and major cardiovascular risk factors .
11752354	4	921	An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS : The odds ratio for myocardial infarction among women who used any type of combined oral contraceptive , as compared with nonusers , was 2 . 0 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 2 . 8 ) .
11752354	5	1242	The adjusted odds ratio was 2 . 5 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 4 . 1 ) among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives and 1 . 3 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 7 to 2 . 5 ) among those who used third - generation oral contraceptives .
11752354	6	1490	Among women who used oral contraceptives , the odds ratio was 2 . 1 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 ) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1 . 9 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 6 to 5 . 5 ) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS : The risk of myocardial infarction was increased among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives .
11752354	7	1843	The results with respect to the use of third - generation oral contraceptives were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second - generation oral contraceptives .
11752354	8	2044	The risk of myocardial infarction was similar among women who used oral contraceptives whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation .
11773892	0	0	End - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) after orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLTX ) using calcineurin - based immunotherapy : risk of development and treatment .
11773892	1	151	BACKGROUND : The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic .
11773892	2	252	Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLTX ) has dramatically improved success rates .
11773892	3	346	Recently , however , we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) .
11773892	4	468	This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in OLTX patients .
11773892	5	588	METHODS : Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied ( n = 834 ) .
11773892	6	729	Our prospectively collected database was the source of information .
11773892	7	797	Patients were divided into three groups : Controls , no CRF or ESRD , n = 748 ; CRF , sustained serum creatinine > 2 . 5 mg / dl , n = 41 ; and ESRD , n = 45 .
11773892	8	937	Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables , diagnosis , postoperative variables , survival , type of ESRD therapy , and survival from onset of ESRD .
11773892	9	1098	RESULTS : At 13 years after OLTX , the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18 . 1 % ( CRF 8 . 6 % and ESRD 9 . 5 % ) .
11773892	10	1209	Compared with control patients , CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels , a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome , higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively , and a higher 1 - year serum creatinine .
11773892	11	1492	Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year , 3 months , and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2 . 6 , 2 . 2 , and 1 . 6 , respectively .
11773892	12	1827	Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups , but by year 13 , the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28 . 2 % compared with 54 . 6 % in the control group .
11773892	13	2027	Patients developing ESRD had a 6 - year survival after onset of ESRD of 27 % for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71 . 4 % for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants .
11773892	14	2233	CONCLUSIONS : Patients who are more than 10 years post - OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate .
11773892	15	2326	The development of ESRD decreases survival , particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only .
11773892	16	2429	Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1 - year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome .
11773892	17	2560	However , an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD .
11773892	18	2688	New strategies for long - term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication .
11807648	0	0	Epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats .
11807648	1	105	BACKGROUND : Fibrin sealants ( FS ) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery .
11807648	2	201	In order to increase clot stability , FS typically contain aprotinin , a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor .
11807648	3	304	Recently , synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tAMCA ) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin .
11807648	4	431	However , tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures .
11807648	5	490	We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS .
11807648	6	580	METHOD : FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA ( 0 . 5 - 47 . 5 mg / ml ) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats .
11807648	7	736	The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia .
11807648	8	892	FINDINGS : FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours .
11807648	9	1013	The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA .
11807648	10	1092	Thus , FS containing 47 . 5 mg / ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n = 6 ) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats .
11807648	11	1318	In contrast , FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity .
11807648	12	1394	INTERPRETATION : Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS .
11807648	13	1467	Thus , use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient .
11875660	0	0	Sequential observations of exencephaly and subsequent morphological changes by mouse exo utero development system : analysis of the mechanism of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly .
11875660	1	192	Anencephaly has been suggested to develop from exencephaly ; however , there is little direct experimental evidence to support this , and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear .
11875660	2	376	We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid - to late - gestation mouse embryos .
11875660	3	527	We observed the exencephaly induced by 5 - azacytidine at embryonic day 13 . 5 ( E13 . 5 ) , let the embryos develop exo utero until E18 . 5 , and re - observed the same embryos at E18 . 5 .
11875660	4	701	We confirmed several cases of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly .
11875660	5	779	However , in many cases , the exencephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period .
11875660	6	895	To analyze the transformation patterns , we classified the exencephaly by size and shape of the exencephalic tissue into several types at E13 . 5 and E18 . 5 .
11875660	7	1049	It was found that the transformation of exencephalic tissue was not simply size - dependent , and all cases of anencephaly at E18 . 5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of exencephalic tissue at E13 . 5 .
11875660	8	1253	Microscopic observation showed the configuration of exencephaly at E13 . 5 , frequent hemorrhaging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the exencephalic head at E15 . 5 , and multiple modes of reduction in the exencephalic tissue at E18 . 5 .
11875660	9	1510	From observations of the vasculature , altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the exencephalic head .
11875660	10	1631	These findings suggest that overgrowth of the exencephalic neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels , subsequent peripheral circulatory failure and / or hemorrhaging in various parts of the exencephalic head , leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly .
11897407	0	0	99mTc - glucarate for detection of isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
11897407	1	86	Infarct - avid radiopharmaceuticals are necessary for rapid and timely diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction .
11897407	2	197	The animal model used to produce infarction implies artery ligation but chemical induction can be easily obtained with isoproterenol .
11897407	3	331	A new infarct - avid radiopharmaceutical based on glucaric acid was prepared in the hospital radiopharmacy of the INCMNSZ . 99mTc - glucarate was easy to prepare , stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with isoproterenol - induced acute myocardial infarction .
11897407	4	611	Histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an infarct 18 h after isoproterenol administration .
11897407	5	721	The rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys .
11897407	6	801	Thirty minutes after 99mTc - glucarate administration the standardised heart uptake value S ( h ) UV was 4 . 7 in infarcted rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats .
11897407	7	972	ROIs drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4 . 4 .
11897407	8	1035	The high image quality suggests that high contrast images can be obtained in humans and the 96 h stability makes it an ideal agent to detect , in patients , early cardiac infarction .
11928786	0	0	Bupropion ( Zyban ) toxicity .
11928786	1	28	Bupropion is a monocyclic antidepressant structurally related to amphetamine .
11928786	2	106	Zyban , a sustained - release formulation of bupropion hydrochloride , was recently released in Ireland , as a smoking cessation aid .
11928786	3	235	In the initial 6 months since it ' s introduction , 12 overdose cases have been reported to The National Poisons Information Centre . 8 patients developed symptoms of toxicity .
11928786	4	408	Common features included tachycardia , drowsiness , hallucinations and convulsions .
11928786	5	490	Two patients developed severe cardiac arrhythmias , including one patient who was resuscitated following a cardiac arrest .
11928786	6	612	All patients recovered without sequelae .
11928786	7	653	We report a case of a 31 year old female who required admission to the Intensive Care Unit for ventilation and full supportive therapy , following ingestion of 13 . 5g bupropion .
11928786	8	829	Recurrent seizures were treated with diazepam and broad complex tachycardia was successfully treated with adenosine .
11928786	9	946	Zyban caused significant neurological and cardiovascular toxicity in overdose .
11928786	10	1025	The potential toxic effects should be considered when prescribing it as a smoking cessation aid .
11961407	0	0	GLEPP1 receptor tyrosine phosphatase ( Ptpro ) in rat PAN nephrosis .
11961407	1	67	A marker of acute podocyte injury .
11961407	2	102	Glomerular epithelial protein 1 ( GLEPP1 ) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes .
11961407	3	299	This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process .
11961407	4	393	To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of glomerular injury , the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry , Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat .
11961407	5	646	Puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN , 20 mg / 100g BW ) .
11961407	6	781	Tissues were analyzed at 0 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 21 , 45 , 80 and 126 days after PAN injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement ( days 5 - 11 ) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis ( days 45 - 126 ) .
11961407	7	1055	At day 5 , GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range ( 265 . 2 + / - 79 . 6 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerulus and 100 % ) to 15 % of normal ( 41 . 8 + / - 4 . 8 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerulus , p < 0 . 005 ) .
11961407	8	1244	This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1 . 8 + / - 1 to 99 . 0 + / - 61 mg / day ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
11961407	9	1367	In contrast , podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time .
11961407	10	1435	By day 11 , GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline .
11961407	11	1508	By day 45 - 126 , at a time when glomerular scarring was present , GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal .
11961407	12	1698	We conclude that GLEPP1 expression , unlike podocalyxin , reflects podocyte injury induced by PAN .
11961407	13	1795	GLEPP1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury .
12041669	0	0	Antithymocyte globulin in the treatment of D - penicillamine - induced aplastic anemia .
12041669	1	84	A patient who received antithymocyte globulin therapy for aplastic anemia due to D - penicillamine therapy is described .
12041669	2	203	Bone marrow recovery and peripheral blood recovery were complete 1 month and 3 months , respectively , after treatment , and blood transfusion or other therapies were not necessary in a follow - up period of more than 2 years .
12041669	3	425	Use of antithymocyte globulin may be the optimal treatment of D - penicillamine - induced aplastic anemia .
12063090	0	0	Metamizol potentiates morphine antinociception but not constipation after chronic treatment .
12063090	1	93	This work evaluates the antinociceptive and constipating effects of the combination of 3 . 2 mg / kg s . c . morphine with 177 . 8 mg / kg s . c . metamizol in acutely and chronically treated ( once a day for 12 days ) rats .
12063090	2	302	On the 13th day , antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception , pain - induced functional impairment model , and the charcoal meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit .
12063090	3	514	Simultaneous administration of morphine with metamizol resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single ( 298 + / - 7 vs . 139 + / - 36 units area ( ua ) ; P < 0 . 001 ) and repeated administration ( 280 + / - 17 vs . 131 + / - 22 ua ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
12063090	4	793	Antinociceptive effect of morphine was reduced in chronically treated rats ( 39 + / - 10 vs . 18 + / - 5 au ) while the combination - induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment ( 298 + / - 7 vs . 280 + / - 17 au ) .
12063090	5	1008	Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3 . 2 mg / kg naloxone s . c . ( P < 0 . 05 ) , suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed .
12063090	6	1207	In independent groups , morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48 + / - 4 % and 38 + / - 4 % after acute and chronic treatment , respectively , suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects .
12063090	7	1415	The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by morphine regardless of the time of treatment , suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine - induced constipation .
12063090	8	1610	These findings show a significant interaction between morphine and metamizol in chronically treated rats , suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of chronic pain .
12084448	0	0	Ifosfamide encephalopathy presenting with asterixis .
12084448	1	53	CNS toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent ifosfamide ( IFX ) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use .
12084448	2	201	We report a case of a 51 - year - old man who developed severe , disabling negative myoclonus of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of ifosfamide for plasmacytoma .
12084448	3	376	He was awake , revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms .
12084448	4	477	Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal structural lesions of the brain and metabolic abnormalities .
12084448	5	623	An electroencephalogram showed continuous , generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic encephalopathy .
12084448	6	773	The administration of ifosfamide was discontinued and within 12 h the asterixis resolved completely .
12084448	7	874	In the patient described , the presence of asterixis during infusion of ifosfamide , normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative myoclonus is associated with the use of IFX .
12090760	0	0	Antagonism between interleukin 3 and erythropoietin in mice with azidothymidine - induced anemia and in bone marrow endothelial cells .
12090760	1	133	Azidothymidine ( AZT ) - induced anemia in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF - IL - 3 ( fusion protein of insulin - like growth factor II ( IGF II ) and interleukin 3 ) .
12090760	2	305	Although interleukin 3 ( IL - 3 ) and erythropoietin ( EPO ) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro , injection of IGF - IL - 3 and EPO in AZT - treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF - IL - 3 or EPO alone .
12090760	3	622	We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL - 3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells .
12090760	4	749	Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF - IL - 3 .
12090760	5	887	There was a significant reduction of thymidine incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre - treated with IGF - IL - 3 and EPO .
12090760	6	1037	Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL - 3 significantly reduced thymidine incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone .
12090760	7	1325	These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL - 3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production .
12198388	0	0	The relationship between hippocampal acetylcholine release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal seizure - prone and withdrawal seizure - resistant selected mouse lines .
12198388	1	181	BACKGROUND : The septo - hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis , and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents , but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal severity .
12198388	2	431	Thus , the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity .
12198388	3	600	METHODS : Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol - na ve Withdrawal Seizure - Prone ( WSP ) and - Resistant ( WSR ) mice .
12198388	4	732	Animals were administered nicotine , carbachol , or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion , and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose .
12198388	5	919	We also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium - stimulated acetylcholine ( ACh ) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus .
12198388	6	1054	Potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice , separated by 75 min .
12198388	7	1124	Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions .
12198388	8	1207	RESULTS : Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine , carbachol , and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice .
12198388	9	1359	In microdialysis experiments , the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh , and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice .
12198388	10	1497	However , the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2 - fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice .
12198388	11	1620	When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions , extracellular ACh was significantly elevated ( 192 % ) in WSP mice , but was nonsignificantly elevated ( 59 % ) in WSR mice .
12198388	12	1821	CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal .
12198388	13	2064	Specifically , WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons .
12202650	0	0	Capsaicin - induced muscle pain alters the excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex .
12202650	1	87	The pathophysiology of painful temporomandibular disorders is not fully understood , but evidence suggests that muscle pain modulates motor function in characteristic ways .
12202650	2	259	This study tested the hypothesis that activation of nociceptive muscle afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex and whether this process would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stretch .
12202650	3	506	Capsaicin ( 10 micro g ) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce pain in 11 healthy volunteers .
12202650	4	608	Short - latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before , during , and after the pain .
12202650	5	790	The normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement , but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity .
12202650	6	958	The normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during pain , but only at faster stretches in the painful muscle .
12202650	7	1080	Increased sensitivity of the fusimotor system during acute muscle pain could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings .
12369736	0	0	Effects of 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbal shell or core on the cocaine - induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats .
12369736	1	137	The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens ( the shell and the core ) on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by cocaine in rats .
12369736	2	360	Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core , and then were locally injected with GR 55562 ( an antagonist of 5 - HT1B receptors ) or CP 93129 ( an agonist of 5 - HT1B receptors ) .
12369736	3	579	Given alone to any accumbal subregion , GR 55562 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) or CP 93129 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) did not change basal locomotor activity .
12369736	4	722	Systemic cocaine ( 10 mg / kg ) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats .
12369736	5	806	GR 55562 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) , administered intra - accumbens shell prior to cocaine , dose - dependently attenuated the psychostimulant - induced locomotor hyperactivity .
12369736	6	971	Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with GR 55562 into the accumbens core .
12369736	7	1076	When injected into the accumbens shell ( but not the core ) before cocaine , CP 93129 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) enhanced the locomotor response to cocaine ; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg / side of the agonist .
12369736	8	1295	The later enhancement was attenuated after intra - accumbens shell treatment with GR 55562 ( 1 microg / side ) .
12369736	9	1401	Our findings indicate that cocaine induced hyperlocomotion is modified by 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell , but not core , this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5 - HT1B receptor antagonist ( GR 55562 ) and agonist ( CP 93129 ) , respectively .
12369736	10	1704	In other words , the present results suggest that the accumbal shell 5 - HT1B receptors play a permissive role in the behavioural response to the psychostimulant .
12443032	0	0	Cocaine related chest pain : are we seeing the tip of an iceberg ?
12443032	1	65	The recreational use of cocaine is on the increase .
12443032	2	117	The emergency nurse ought to be familiar with some of the cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use .
12443032	3	219	In particular , the tendency of cocaine to produce chest pain ought to be in the mind of the emergency nurse when faced with a young victim of chest pain who is otherwise at low risk .
12443032	4	402	The mechanism of chest pain related to cocaine use is discussed and treatment dilemmas are discussed .
12443032	5	504	Finally , moral issues relating to the testing of potential cocaine users will be addressed .
12464714	0	0	Crossover comparison of efficacy and preference for rizatriptan 10 mg versus ergotamine / caffeine in migraine .
12464714	1	110	Rizatriptan is a selective 5 - HT ( 1B / 1D ) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine .
12464714	2	255	This randomized double - blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg / caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single migraine attack with each therapy .
12464714	3	481	Of patients expressing a preference ( 89 . 1 % ) , more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to ergotamine / caffeine ( 69 . 9 vs . 30 . 1 % , p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
12464714	4	629	Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference , cited by 67 . 3 % of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54 . 2 % of patients who preferred ergotamine / caffeine .
12464714	5	808	The co - primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan .
12464714	6	892	Forty - nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan , compared with 24 . 3 % treated with ergotamine / caffeine ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) , rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment .
12464714	7	1084	Headache relief at 2 h was 75 . 9 % for rizatriptan and 47 . 3 % for ergotamine / caffeine ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) , with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine / caffeine within 30 min of dosing .
12464714	8	1265	Almost 36 % of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h , compared to 20 % of patients on ergotamine / caffeine ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
12464714	9	1467	Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine / caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea , vomiting , phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
12464714	10	1682	More patients were ( completely , very or somewhat ) satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan ( 69 . 8 % ) than at 2 h after treatment with ergotamine / caffeine ( 38 . 6 % , p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
12464714	11	1865	Recurrence rates were 31 . 4 % with rizatriptan and 15 . 3 % with ergotamine / caffeine .
12464714	12	1946	Both active treatments were well tolerated .
12464714	13	1990	The most common adverse events ( incidence > or = 5 % in one group ) after rizatriptan and ergotamine / caffeine , respectively , were dizziness ( 6 . 7 and 5 . 3 % ) , nausea ( 4 . 2 and 8 . 5 % ) and somnolence ( 5 . 5 and 2 . 3 % ) .
12483326	0	0	Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas .
12483326	1	108	BACKGROUND : Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood .
12483326	2	200	With current treatment regimens including combined surgery , radiation and chemotherapy , the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year .
12483326	3	368	Therefore , patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen .
12483326	4	494	Generally , carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin , whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known .
12483326	5	619	However , we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin , which is infrequently reported .
12483326	6	765	CASE : A 58 - year - old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe .
12483326	7	894	He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection .
12483326	8	988	Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen .
12483326	9	1067	RESULTS : He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection .
12483326	10	1187	Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle - closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished , inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks .
12483326	11	1397	Finally , 6 weeks later , diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost .
12483326	12	1520	CONCLUSION : When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin , we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity .
12483326	13	1649	It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects .
12523465	0	0	Visual hallucinations associated with zonisamide .
12523465	1	50	Zonisamide is a broad - spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of seizures .
12523465	2	141	Although visual hallucinations have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent , we describe three patients who experienced complex visual hallucinations and altered mental status after zonisamide treatment was begun or its dosage increased .
12523465	3	392	All three had been diagnosed earlier with epilepsy , and their electroencephalogram ( EEG ) findings were abnormal .
12523465	4	505	During monitoring , visual hallucinations did not correlate with EEG readings , nor did video recording capture any of the described events .
12523465	5	644	None of the patients had experienced visual hallucinations before this event .
12523465	6	722	The only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of zonisamide .
12523465	7	820	With either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur .
12523465	8	924	Further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effect .
12523465	9	996	Until then , clinicians need to be aware of this possible complication associated with zonisamide .
12536034	0	0	Anti - epileptic drugs - induced de novo absence seizures .
12536034	1	55	The authors present three patients with de novo absence epilepsy after administration of carbamazepine and vigabatrin .
12536034	2	174	Despite the underlying diseases , the prognosis for drug - induced de novo absence seizure is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs .
12536034	3	350	The gamma - aminobutyric acid - transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the absence epilepsy .
12536034	4	501	Because drug - induced de novo absence seizure is rare , pro - absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor .
12536034	5	616	The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo absence seizure .
12536034	6	769	The possibility of drug - induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in seizure frequency and / or new seizure types appear following a change in drug treatment .
12536034	7	957	By understanding the underlying mechanism of absence epilepsy , we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with epilepsy and prevent drug - induced absence seizures .
12574103	0	0	Prenatal dexamethasone programs hypertension and renal injury in the rat .
12574103	1	74	Dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development .
12574103	2	176	The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase in blood pressure and renal injury in rats .
12574103	3	330	Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone ( 0 . 2 mg / kg body weight ) on gestational days 11 and 12 , 13 and 14 , 15 and 16 , 17 and 18 , or 19 and 20 .
12574103	4	527	Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20 % reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age ( 22 527 + / - 509 versus 28 050 + / - 561 , P < 0 . 05 ) , which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age .
12574103	5	818	Six - to 9 - month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17 % reduction in glomeruli ( 23 380 + / - 587 ) compared with control rats ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
12574103	6	992	Male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 , 17 and 18 , and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of age ; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular number .
12574103	7	1209	Adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats .
12574103	8	1333	This study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number , glomerulosclerosis , and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation .
12574103	9	1523	Hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number , suggesting that a reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension .
12584269	0	0	Kidney function and morphology after short - term combination therapy with cyclosporine A , tacrolimus and sirolimus in the rat .
12584269	1	126	BACKGROUND : Sirolimus ( SRL ) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation .
12584269	2	227	These are nephrotoxic , but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects , although this question is still open .
12584269	3	364	In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described .
12584269	4	515	The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function , including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A ( CsA ) , tacrolimus ( FK506 ) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations .
12584269	5	771	METHODS : For a period of 2 weeks , CsA 15 mg / kg / day ( given orally ) , FK506 3 . 0 mg / kg / day ( given orally ) or SRL 0 . 4 mg / kg / day ( given intraperitoneally ) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague - Dawley rats .
12584269	6	1061	In the ' conscious catheterized rat ' model , the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was measured as the clearance of Cr ( EDTA ) .
12584269	7	1184	The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi - quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis , subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules , plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red .
12584269	8	1483	RESULTS : CsA , FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR .
12584269	9	1548	A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL , whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances .
12584269	10	1769	The morphological changes presented a similar pattern .
12584269	11	1824	The semi - quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL ( P < 0 . 001 compared with controls ) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls ( P < 0 . 02 ) .
12584269	12	2107	The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls ( P = 0 . 05 ) .
12584269	13	2225	CONCLUSION : This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL , whereas FK506 plus SRL was better tolerated .
12589964	0	0	Evaluation of cardiac troponin I and T levels as markers of myocardial damage in doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy rats , and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings .
12589964	1	195	BACKGROUND : Cardiac troponins I ( cTnI ) and T ( cTnT ) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial cell injury .
12589964	2	334	We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin ( DOX ) - induced cardiomyopathy , and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model .
12589964	3	666	METHODS : Thirty - five Wistar rats were given 1 . 5 mg / kg DOX , i . v . , weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg / kg BW .
12589964	4	800	Ten rats received saline as a control group .
12589964	5	845	cTnI was measured with Access ( R ) ( ng / ml ) and a research immunoassay ( pg / ml ) , and compared with cTnT , CK - MB mass and CK .
12589964	6	965	By using transthoracic echocardiography , anterior and posterior wall thickness , LV diameters and LV fractional shortening ( FS ) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline , and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats .
12589964	7	1200	Histology was performed in DOX - rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls .
12589964	8	1298	RESULTS : Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9 - week period .
12589964	9	1395	End - diastolic ( ED ) and end - systolic ( ES ) LV diameters / BW significantly increased , whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
12589964	10	1547	These parameters remained unchanged in controls .
12589964	11	1596	Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis .
12589964	12	1733	In 7 of the 18 rats , degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found .
12589964	13	1805	Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis .
12589964	14	1888	A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7 . 5 and 12 mg / kg in comparison with baseline ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
12589964	15	2018	cTnT found in rats after 12 mg / kg were significantly greater than that found after 7 . 5 mg / kg DOX .
12589964	16	2116	Maximal cTnI ( pg / ml ) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls ( p = 0 . 006 , 0 . 007 ) .
12589964	17	2235	cTnI ( ng / ml ) , CK - MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls .
12589964	18	2322	All markers remained stable in controls .
12589964	19	2363	Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters / BW ( r = 0 . 81 and 0 . 65 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
12589964	20	2495	A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes , and between LV diameters / BW and histological findings .
12589964	21	2663	CONCLUSIONS : Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats , cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes .
12589964	22	2855	Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX , probably due to heterogeneity in cross - reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms , it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments .
12596116	0	0	Octreotide - induced hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension in premature neonates .
12596116	1	79	The authors report 2 cases of premature neonates who had enterocutaneous fistula complicating necrotizing enterocolitis .
12596116	2	200	Pulmonary hypertension developed after administration of a somatostatin analogue , octreotide , to enhance resolution of the fistula .
12596116	3	332	The authors discuss the mechanism of the occurrence of this complication and recommend caution of its use in high - risk premature neonates .
12615818	0	0	The risk of venous thromboembolism in women prescribed cyproterone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol : a nested cohort analysis and case - control study .
12615818	1	163	BACKGROUND : Cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl estradiol ( CPA / EE ) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment option for polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) .
12615818	2	378	Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) associated with CPA / EE compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) .
12615818	3	550	We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding .
12615818	4	638	METHODS : Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case - control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne , hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA / EE .
12615818	5	892	RESULTS : The age - adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA / EE versus conventional COCs was 2 . 20 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1 . 35 - 3 . 58 ] .
12615818	6	1026	Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception , had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms , the case - control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ( adj ) ) of 7 . 44 ( 95 % CI 3 . 67 - 15 . 08 ) for CPA / EE use compared with an OR ( adj ) of 2 . 58 ( 95 % CI 1 . 60 - 4 . 18 ) for use of conventional COCs .
12615818	7	1337	CONCLUSIONS : We have demonstrated an increased risk of VTE associated with the use of CPA / EE in women with acne , hirsutism or PCOS although residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded .
12617329	0	0	The effect of treatment with gum Arabic on gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats : a preliminary study .
12617329	1	99	In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with gum Arabic on acute renal failure induced by gentamicin ( GM ) nephrotoxicity .
12617329	2	245	Rats were treated with the vehicle ( 2 mL / kg of distilled water and 5 % w / v cellulose , 10 days ) , gum Arabic ( 2 mL / kg of a 10 % w / v aqueous suspension of gum Arabic powder , orally for 10 days ) , or gum Arabic concomitantly with GM ( 80mg / kg / day intramuscularly , during the last six days of the treatment period ) .
12617329	3	552	Nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione ( GSH ) in the kidney cortex , and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections .
12617329	4	758	The results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum Arabic and GM significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239 % , respectively ( compared to 432 and 346 % , respectively , in rats treated with cellulose and GM ) , and decreased that of cortical GSH by 21 % ( compared to 27 % in the cellulose plus GM group ) The GM - induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose .
12617329	5	1239	It could be inferred that gum Arabic treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of GM nephrotoxicity .
12617329	6	1394	Further work is warranted on the effect of the treatments on renal functional aspects in models of chronic renal failure , and on the mechanism ( s ) involved .
12627929	0	0	Increased frequency of venous thromboembolism with the combination of docetaxel and thalidomide in patients with metastatic androgen - independent prostate cancer .
12627929	1	162	STUDY OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the frequency of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) in patients with advanced androgen - independent prostate cancer who were treated with docetaxel alone or in combination with thalidomide .
12627929	2	374	DESIGN : Retrospective analysis of a randomized phase II trial .
12627929	3	437	SETTING : National Institutes of Health clinical research center .
12627929	4	502	PATIENTS : Seventy men , aged 50 - 80 years , with advanced androgen - independent prostate cancer .
12627929	5	595	INTERVENTION : Each patient received either intravenous docetaxel 30 mg / m2 / week for 3 consecutive weeks , followed by 1 week off , or the combination of continuous oral thalidomide 200 mg every evening plus the same docetaxel regimen .
12627929	6	827	This 4 - week cycle was repeated until there was evidence of excessive toxicity or disease progression .
12627929	7	929	MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : None of 23 patients who received docetaxel alone developed VTE , whereas 9 of 47 patients ( 19 % ) who received docetaxel plus thalidomide developed VTE ( p = 0 . 025 ) .
12627929	8	1120	CONCLUSION : The addition of thalidomide to docetaxel in the treatment of prostate cancer significantly increases the frequency of VTE .
12627929	9	1255	Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication when adding thalidomide to chemotherapeutic regimens .
12639165	0	0	Ticlopidine - induced cholestatic hepatitis .
12639165	1	43	OBJECTIVE : To report 2 cases of ticlopidine - induced cholestatic hepatitis , investigate its mechanism , and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases .
12639165	2	226	CASE SUMMARIES : Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty , with complete remission during the follow - up period .
12639165	3	423	T - cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ticlopidine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients , but not in healthy controls .
12639165	4	558	DISCUSSION : Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine ; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature .
12639165	5	722	Our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ticlopidine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis , which resolved after discontinuation of the drug .
12639165	6	922	Hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course , but complete remission was observed in all reported cases .
12639165	7	1075	An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of ticlopidine .
12639165	8	1194	The mechanisms of this ticlopidine - induced cholestasis are unclear .
12639165	9	1262	Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug ' s hepatotoxicity , as suggested by the T - cell stimulation study reported here .
12639165	10	1386	CONCLUSIONS : Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of ticlopidine that may be immune mediated .
12639165	11	1490	Patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell counts .
12639165	12	1603	This complication will be observed even less often in the future as ticlopidine is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent clopidogrel .

12653683	2	249	The molecular mechanism ( s ) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated .
12653683	3	338	The rate - limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) .
12653683	4	445	We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) - induced nephrotic syndrome .
12653683	5	569	The time courses of urinary sodium excretion , plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle .
12653683	6	758	The relative amounts of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real - time quantitative TaqMan PCR , and the amounts of proteins by Western blot .
12653683	7	948	The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously .
12653683	8	1071	Sodium retention occurred on days 2 , 3 and 6 after PAN injection .
12653683	9	1137	A significant up - regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3 .
12653683	10	1265	Conversely , down - regulation of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations , and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values .
12653683	11	1484	The amounts of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN - induced sodium retention .
12653683	12	1598	In conclusion , ENaC mRNA expression , especially alphaENaC , is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN - induced nephrotic syndrome in rats , but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3 .
12684739	0	0	Sub - chronic low dose gamma - vinyl GABA ( vigabatrin ) inhibits cocaine - induced increases in nucleus accumbens dopamine .
12684739	1	117	RATIONALE : gamma - Vinyl GABA ( GVG ) irreversibly inhibits GABA - transaminase .
12684739	2	192	This non - receptor mediated inhibition requires de novo synthesis for restoration of functional GABA catabolism .
12684739	3	304	OBJECTIVES : Given its preclinical success for treating substance abuse and the increased risk of visual field defects ( VFD ) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure , we explored the effects of sub - chronic low dose GVG on cocaine - induced increases in nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) dopamine ( DA ) .
12684739	4	598	METHODS : Using in vivo microdialysis , we compared acute exposure ( 450 mg / kg ) to an identical sub - chronic exposure ( 150 mg / kg per day for 3 days ) , followed by 1 - or 3 - day washout .
12684739	5	777	Finally , we examined the low dose of 150 mg / kg ( 50 mg / kg per day ) using a similar washout period .
12684739	6	875	RESULTS : Sub - chronic GVG exposure inhibited the effect of cocaine for 3 days , which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose .
12684739	7	1020	CONCLUSIONS : Sub - chronic low dose GVG potentiates and extends the inhibition of cocaine - induced increases in dopamine , effectively reducing cumulative exposures and the risk for VFDS .
12695819	0	0	MR imaging with quantitative diffusion mapping of tacrolimus - induced neurotoxicity in organ transplant patients .
12695819	1	113	Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion - weighted ( DW ) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy .
12695819	2	313	Brain MR studies , including DW imaging , were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications .
12695819	3	475	In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study , a follow - up MR study was performed 1 month later .
12695819	4	588	Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions .
12695819	5	707	Of the 14 patients , 5 ( 35 . 7 % ) had white matter abnormalities , 1 ( 7 . 1 % ) had putaminal hemorrhage , and 8 ( 57 . 1 % ) had normal findings on initial MR images .
12695819	6	860	Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities , 4 patients ( 80 . 0 % ) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images , and all showed complete resolution on follow - up images .
12695819	7	1048	The remaining 1 patient ( 20 . 0 % ) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis .
12695819	8	1180	Diffusion - weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus - induced neurotoxicity .
12707296	0	0	L - arginine transport in humans with cortisol - induced hypertension .
12707296	1	67	A deficient L - arginine - nitric oxide system is implicated in cortisol - induced hypertension .
12707296	2	158	We investigate whether abnormalities in L - arginine uptake contribute to this deficiency .
12707296	3	247	Eight healthy men were recruited .
12707296	4	281	Hydrocortisone acetate ( 50 mg ) was given orally every 6 hours for 24 hours after a 5 - day fixed - salt diet ( 150 mmol / d ) .
12707296	5	400	Crossover studies were performed 2 weeks apart .
12707296	6	448	Thirty milliliters of blood was obtained for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after each treatment period .
12707296	7	570	L - arginine uptake was assessed in mononuclear cells incubated with L - arginine ( 1 to 300 micromol / L ) , incorporating 100 nmol / L [ 3H ] - l - arginine for a period of 5 minutes at 37 degrees C . Forearm [ 3H ] - L - arginine extraction was calculated after infusion of [ 3H ] - L - arginine into the brachial artery at a rate of 100 nCi / min for 80 minutes .
12707296	8	905	Deep forearm venous samples were collected for determination of L - arginine extraction .
12707296	9	992	Plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly raised during the active phase ( 323 + / - 43 to 1082 + / - 245 mmol / L , P < 0 . 05 ) .
12707296	10	1114	Systolic blood pressure was elevated by an average of 7 mm Hg .
12707296	11	1177	Neither L - arginine transport into mononuclear cells ( placebo vs active , 26 . 3 + / - 3 . 6 vs 29 . 0 + / - 2 . 1 pmol / 10 000 cells per 5 minutes , respectively , at an l - arginine concentration of 300 micromol / L ) nor L - arginine extraction in the forearm ( at 80 minutes , placebo vs active , 1 868 904 + / - 434 962 vs 2 013 910 + / - 770 619 disintegrations per minute ) was affected by cortisol treatment ; ie , that L - arginine uptake is not affected by short - term cortisol treatment .
12707296	12	1631	We conclude that cortisol - induced increases in blood pressure are not associated with abnormalities in the l - arginine transport system .
12716030	0	0	Amount of bleeding and hematoma size in the collagenase - induced intracerebral hemorrhage rat model .
12716030	1	100	The aggravated risk on intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) with drugs used for stroke patients should be estimated carefully .
12716030	2	221	We therefore established sensitive quantification methods and provided a rat ICH model for detection of ICH deterioration .
12716030	3	344	In ICH intrastriatally induced by 0 . 014 - unit , 0 . 070 - unit , and 0 . 350 - unit collagenase , the amount of bleeding was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined hematoma volume .
12716030	4	592	The blood amounts and hematoma volumes were significantly correlated , and the hematoma induced by 0 . 014 - unit collagenase was adequate to detect ICH deterioration .
12716030	5	755	In ICH induction using 0 . 014 - unit collagenase , heparin enhanced the hematoma volume 3 . 4 - fold over that seen in control ICH animals and the bleeding 7 . 6 - fold .
12716030	6	913	Data suggest that this sensitive hemoglobin assay is useful for ICH detection , and that a model with a small ICH induced with a low - dose collagenase should be used for evaluation of drugs that may affect ICH .
12757899	0	0	Estradiol reduces seizure - induced hippocampal injury in ovariectomized female but not in male rats .
12757899	1	100	Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from hippocampal injury induced by kainic acid - induced status epilepticus ( SE ) .
12757899	2	218	We compared the effects of 17beta - estradiol in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to lithium - pilocarpine - induced SE .
12757899	3	352	Rats received subcutaneous injections of 17beta - estradiol ( 2 microg / rat ) or oil once daily for four consecutive days .
12757899	4	470	SE was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later .
12757899	5	547	The extent of silver - stained CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after SE . 17beta - Estradiol did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males . 17beta - Estradiol reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA1 and CA3 - C sectors of ovariectomized rats .
12757899	6	851	In males , estradiol increased the total damage score .
12757899	7	905	These findings suggest that the effects of estradiol on seizure threshold and damage may be altered by sex - related differences in the hormonal environment .
12789195	0	0	Pseudoacromegaly induced by the long - term use of minoxidil .
12789195	1	60	Acromegaly is an endocrine disorder caused by chronic excessive growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland .
12789195	2	184	Significant disfiguring changes occur as a result of bone , cartilage , and soft tissue hypertrophy , including the thickening of the skin , coarsening of facial features , and cutis verticis gyrata .
12789195	3	379	Pseudoacromegaly , on the other hand , is the presence of similar acromegaloid features in the absence of elevated growth hormone or insulin - like growth factor levels .
12789195	4	545	We present a patient with pseudoacromegaly that resulted from the long - term use of minoxidil at an unusually high dose .
12789195	5	665	This is the first case report of pseudoacromegaly as a side effect of minoxidil use .
12820454	0	0	Combined androgen blockade - induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement .
12820454	1	96	BACKGROUND : To determine the onset and extent of combined androgen blockade ( CAB ) - induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement .
12820454	2	247	PATIENTS AND METHODS : Forty - two patients with biopsy - proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [ 26 with stage C ( T3N0M0 ) and 16 with stage D1 ( T3N1M0 ) ] were included in this study .
12820454	3	418	All patients received CAB [ leuprolide acetate ( LHRH - A ) 3 . 75 mg , intramuscularly , every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide , tid , per Os ] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals ( 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 months post - CAB ) .
12820454	4	696	Hb , PSA and Testosterone measurements were recorded .
12820454	5	749	Patients with stage D2 - 3 disease , abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study .
12820454	6	912	The duration of the study was six months .
12820454	7	954	RESULTS : The mean hemoglobin ( Hb ) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14 . 2 g / dl to 14 . 0 g / dl , 13 . 5 g / dl , 13 . 2 g / dl and 12 . 7 g / dl at 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 months post - CAB , respectively .
12820454	8	1163	Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb < 11 g / dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients ( 14 . 3 % ) .
12820454	9	1275	This CAB - induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic .
12820454	10	1332	At six months post - CAB , patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10 . 2 + / - 0 . 1 g / dl ( X + / - SE ) , whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13 . 2 + / - 0 . 17 ( X + / - SE ) .
12820454	11	1528	The development of severe anemia at 6 months post - CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2 . 5 g / dl after 3 months of CAB ( p = 0 . 01 ) .
12820454	12	1692	The development of severe CAB - induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values ( T < 3 ng / ml versus T > or = 3 ng / ml ) , with age ( < 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs ) , and clinical stage ( stage C versus stage D1 ) .
12820454	13	1933	Severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections ( 3 times / week for 1 month ) of recombinant erythropoietin ( rHuEPO - beta ) .
12820454	14	2090	CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that rHuEPO - beta correctable CAB - induced anemia occurs in 14 . 3 % of prostate cancer patients after 6 months of therapy .
12905102	0	0	Delirium during clozapine treatment : incidence and associated risk factors .
12905102	1	76	BACKGROUND : Incidence and risk factors for delirium during clozapine treatment require further clarification .
12905102	2	186	METHODS : We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult psychiatric inpatients treated with clozapine ( 1995 - 96 ) , reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of delirium , and tested associations with potential risk factors .
12905102	3	441	RESULTS : Subjects ( n = 139 ) were 72 women and 67 men , aged 40 . 8 + / - 12 . 1 years , hospitalized for 24 . 9 + / - 23 . 3 days , and given clozapine , gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 + / - 203 mg ( 3 . 45 + / - 2 . 45 mg / kg ) for 18 . 9 + / - 16 . 4 days .
12905102	4	688	Delirium was diagnosed in 14 ( 10 . 1 % incidence , or 1 . 48 cases / person - years of exposure ) ; 71 . 4 % of cases were moderate or severe .
12905102	5	818	Associated factors were co - treatment with other centrally antimuscarinic agents , poor clinical outcome , older age , and longer hospitalization ( by 17 . 5 days , increasing cost ) ; sex , diagnosis or medical co - morbidity , and daily clozapine dose , which fell with age , were unrelated .
12905102	6	1096	CONCLUSIONS : Delirium was found in 10 % of clozapine - treated inpatients , particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics .
12905102	7	1243	Delirium was inconsistently recognized clinically in milder cases and was associated with increased length - of - stay and higher costs , and inferior clinical outcome .
12907309	0	0	Neuroprotective action of MPEP , a selective mGluR5 antagonist , in methamphetamine - induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is associated with a decrease in dopamine outflow and inhibition of hyperthermia in rats .
12907309	1	207	The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ( mGluR5 ) in the toxic action of methamphetamine on dopaminergic neurones in rats .
12907309	2	372	Methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) , administered five times , reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection .
12907309	3	543	A selective antagonist of mGluR5 , 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine ( MPEP ; 5 mg / kg ip ) , when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above - mentioned methamphetamine effects .
12907309	4	765	A single MPEP ( 5 mg / kg ip ) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum , as well as dopamine release stimulated either by methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine ( 100 microM ) .
12907309	5	1006	Moreover , it transiently diminished the methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) - induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature .
12907309	6	1133	MPEP administered into the striatum at high concentrations ( 500 microM ) increased extracellular dopamine levels , while lower concentrations ( 50 - 100 microM ) were devoid of any effect .
12907309	7	1316	The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by MPEP may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine - induced toxicity .
12907309	8	1462	Neuroprotection rendered by MPEP may be associated with the reduction of the methamphetamine - induced dopamine efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5 , and with a decrease in hyperthermia .
12921865	0	0	Protective efficacy of neuroactive steroids against cocaine kindled - seizures in mice .
12921865	1	86	Neuroactive steroids demonstrate pharmacological actions that have relevance for a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders .
12921865	2	217	They offer protection against seizures in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of drug dependence in preclinical assessments .
12921865	3	359	The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ( A ) ) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration ( seizure kindling ) .
12921865	4	666	Allopregnanolone ( 3alpha - hydroxy - 5alpha - pregnan - 20 - one ) , pregnanolone ( 3alpha - hydroxy - 5beta - pregnan - 20 - one ) and ganaxolone ( a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha - hydroxy - 3beta - methyl - 5alpha - pregnan - 20 - one ) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression ( anticonvulsant effect ) and development ( antiepileptogenic effect ) of cocaine - kindled seizures in male , Swiss - Webster mice .
12921865	5	1065	Kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg / kg cocaine for 5 days .
12921865	6	1151	All of these positive GABA ( A ) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures , whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling .
12921865	7	1323	Allopregnanolone and pregnanolone , but not ganaxolone , also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling .
12921865	8	1438	These findings demonstrate that some neuroactive steroids attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of cocaine and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of drugs of abuse .
137340	0	0	Effect of humoral modulators of morphine - induced increase in locomotor activity of mice .
137340	1	89	The effect of humoral modulators on the morphine - induced increase in locomotor activity of mice was studied .
137340	2	198	The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg / kg of morphine - HC1 produced a marked increase in locomotor activity in mice .
137340	3	316	The morphine - induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine .
137340	4	415	In contrast , both methscopolamine and neostigmine , which do not penetrate the blood - brain barrier , had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine .
137340	5	571	Pretreatment of mice with alpha - methyltyrosine ( 20 mg / kg i . p . , one hour ) , an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase , significantly decreased the activity - increasing effects of morphine .
137340	6	752	On the other hand , pretreatment with p - chlorophenylalamine ( 3 X 320 mg / kg i . p . , 24 hr ) , a serotonin depletor , caused no significant change in the hyperactivity .
137340	7	913	The study suggests that the activity - increasing effects of morphine are mediated by the release of catecholamines from adrenergic neurons in the brain .
137340	8	1065	And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine acts by retarding the release of acetylcholine at some central cholinergic synapses .
137340	9	1215	It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity - increasing effects of morphine in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity - increasing effects of morphine in rats .
1378968	0	0	Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium - induced chronic renal failure in rats .
1378968	1	101	Rats with lithium - induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein ( HP ) feeding , uninephrectomy ( NX ) or a combination of these , in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure .
1378968	2	324	Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium - containing diet ( 50 mmol / kg ) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet , HP diet ( 40 vs . 19 % ) , NX or HP + NX for another 8 weeks .
1378968	3	502	Corresponding non - lithium pretreated groups were generated .
1378968	4	562	When comparing all lithium treated versus non - lithium - treated groups , lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules ) or lithium clearance .
1378968	5	839	Consequently , lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion .
1378968	6	955	Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis .
1378968	7	1047	HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats .
1378968	8	1202	NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which , however , was ameliorated by HP .
1378968	9	1284	NX + HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li - pretreated rats .
1378968	10	1353	The results indicate that Li - induced nephropathy , even when the GFR is only modestly reduced , is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension .
1378968	11	1514	In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow , which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli .
1378968	12	1740	The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced , leaving the distal delivery unchanged . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
1420741	0	0	Treatment of Crohn ' s disease with fusidic acid : an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclosporin .
1420741	1	120	Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T - cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin .
1420741	2	230	Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn ' s disease , a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active , therapy - resistant patients .
1420741	3	461	Eight Crohn ' s disease patients were included .
1420741	4	507	Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t . d . s . and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks .
1420741	5	618	The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score .
1420741	6	702	Five of 8 patients ( 63 % ) improved during fusidic acid treatment : 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks .
1420741	7	806	There were no serious clinical side effects , but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea .
1420741	8	918	Biochemically , an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases ( 63 % ) , and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment .
1420741	9	1093	All reversed to pre - treatment levels after cessation of treatment .
1420741	10	1160	The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn ' s disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective .
1420741	11	1335	Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease , we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated .
1428568	0	0	Changes in depressive status associated with topical beta - blockers .
1428568	1	68	Depression and sexual dysfunction have been related to side effects of topical beta - blockers .
1428568	2	162	We performed a preliminary study in order to determine any difference between a non selective beta - blocker ( timolol ) and a selective beta - blocker ( betaxolol ) regarding CNS side effects .
1428568	3	348	Eight glaucomatous patients chronically treated with timolol 0 . 5 % / 12h , suffering from depression diagnosed through DMS - III - R criteria , were included in the study .
1428568	4	511	During the six - month follow up , depression was quantified through the Beck and Zung - Conde scales every two months .
1428568	5	626	In a double blind cross - over study with control group , the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the Beck and the Zung - Conde scales ( p < 0 . 001 vs control ) .
1428568	6	829	These results suggest that betaxolol could be less of a depression - inducer than timolol in predisposed patients .
1436384	0	0	Protection against amphetamine - induced neurotoxicity toward striatal dopamine neurons in rodents by LY274614 , an excitatory amino acid antagonist .
1436384	1	147	LY274614 , 3SR , 4aRS , 6SR , 8aRS - 6 - [ phosphonomethyl ] decahydr oisoquinoline - 3 - carboxylic acid , has been described as a potent antagonist of the N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) subtype of glutamate receptor .
1436384	2	345	Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole - treated rats is reported .
1436384	3	482	A single 18 . 4 mg / kg ( i . p . ) dose of ( + / - ) - amphetamine hemisulfate , given to rats pretreated with iprindole , resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later .
1436384	4	664	This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine ( MK - 801 , a non - competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors ) or by LY274614 ( a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors ) .
1436384	5	866	The protective effect of LY274614 was dose - dependent , being maximum at 10 - 40 mgkg ( i . p . ) .
1436384	6	956	A 10 mg / kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum , when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine .
1436384	7	1152	Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine ; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine .
1436384	8	1367	The prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice , given multiple injections of methamphetamine , was also antagonized dose - dependently and completely by LY274614 .
1436384	9	1540	The data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves NMDA receptors and that LY274614 is an NMDA receptor antagonist with long - lasting in vivo effects in rats .
14513889	0	0	Ketoconazole - induced neurologic sequelae .
14513889	1	42	A 77 - y - old patient developed weakness of extremities , legs paralysis , dysarthria and tremor 1 h after ingestion of 200 mg ketoconazole for the first time in his life .
14513889	2	209	All complaints faded away within 24 h . Few days later , the patient used another 200 mg ketoconazole tablet , and within an hour experienced a similar clinical picture , which resolved again spontaneously within hours .
14513889	3	425	Laboratory evaluations , including head CT scan , were normal .
14513889	4	486	This case illustrates the need for close vigilance in adverse drug reactions , particularly in the elderly .
14568327	0	0	Development of levodopa - induced dyskinesias in parkinsonian monkeys may depend upon rate of symptom onset and / or duration of symptoms .
14568327	1	135	Levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LIDs ) present a major problem for the long - term management of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) patients .
14568327	2	262	Due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations , it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of LIDs .
14568327	3	423	Using macaque monkeys with different types of MPTP - induced parkinsonism , the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression , symptom severity , and response to and duration of levodopa therapy may be involved in the development of LIDs .
14568327	4	684	Monkeys with acute ( short - term ) MPTP exposure , rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy developed dyskinesia between 11 and 24 days of daily levodopa administration .
14568327	5	896	In contrast , monkeys with long - term MPTP exposure , slow symptom progression and / or long symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy were more resistant to developing LIDs ( e . g . , dyskinesia developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic levodopa administration ) .
14568327	6	1169	All animals were similarly symptomatic at the start of levodopa treatment and had similar therapeutic responses to the drug .
14568327	7	1294	These data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop LIDs in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to levodopa and demonstrate the value of these models for further studying the pathophysiology of LIDs .
14596845	0	0	A diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross - sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine .
14596845	1	102	Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency .
14596845	2	289	The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross - sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine .
14596845	3	444	After a 30 - min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0 ) , animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12 - h deprivation followed by 12 - h access to 10 % sucrose solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period ) for 21 days .
14596845	4	704	Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access .
14596845	5	804	Beginning on day 22 , all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow .
14596845	6	870	Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .
14596845	7	979	The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10 % sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection , cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection , ad libitum chow with amphetamine , or cyclic 10 % sucrose and chow with a saline injection ) .
14596845	8	1320	These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine , possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system .
14657095	0	0	Reversible dilated cardiomyopathy related to amphotericin B therapy .
14657095	1	69	We describe a patient who developed dilated cardiomyopathy and clinical congestive heart failure after 2 months of therapy with amphotericin B ( AmB ) for disseminated coccidioidomycosis .
14657095	2	255	His echocardiographic abnormalities and heart failure resolved after posaconazole was substituted for AmB .
14657095	3	362	It is important to recognize the rare and potentially reversible toxicity of AmB .
14659530	0	0	NO - induced migraine attack : strong increase in plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) concentration and negative correlation with platelet serotonin release .
14659530	1	165	The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) concentration and platelet serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytriptamine , 5 - HT ) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin .
14659530	2	444	Fifteen female migraineurs ( without aura ) and eight controls participated in the study .
14659530	3	532	Sublingual nitroglycerin ( 0 . 5 mg ) was administered .
14659530	4	584	Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times : 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application , and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack ( mean 344 and 404 min ; 12 subjects ) .
14659530	5	796	In those subjects who had no migraine attack ( 11 subjects ) a similar time schedule was used .
14659530	6	889	Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine .
14659530	7	1037	In addition , both change and peak , showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
14659530	8	1157	However , plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack .
14659530	9	1281	Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5 - HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack .
14659530	10	1423	Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack .
14659530	11	1611	In conclusion , the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine .
14659530	12	1787	In contrast , serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine , it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this model .
1468485	0	0	Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for control of intractable cyclophosphamide - induced hemorrhagic cystitis .
1468485	1	100	We report a case of intractable hemorrhagic cystitis due to cyclophosphamide therapy for Wegener ' s granulomatosis .
1468485	2	215	Conservative treatment , including bladder irrigation with physiological saline and instillation of prostaglandin F2 alpha , failed to totally control hemorrhage .
1468485	3	376	We then used hyperbaric oxygen at an absolute pressure of 2 atm , 5 days a week for 8 consecutive weeks .
1468485	4	480	The bleeding ceased completely by the end of treatment and the patient remained free of hematuria thereafter .
1468485	5	590	No side effect was noted during the course of therapy .
1468485	6	645	In future , this form of therapy can offer a safe alternative in the treatment of cyclophosphamide - induced hemorrhagic cystitis .
14698717	0	0	Acute psychosis due to treatment with phenytoin in a nonepileptic patient .
14698717	1	75	The development of psychosis related to antiepileptic drug treatment is usually attributed to the interaction between the epileptic brain substratum and the antiepileptic drugs .
14698717	2	253	The case of a nonepileptic patient who developed psychosis following phenytoin treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is described .
14698717	3	381	This case suggests that the psychotic symptoms that occur following phenytoin treatment in some epileptic patients may be the direct result of medication , unrelated to seizures .
14765563	0	0	Risks of the consumption of beverages containing quinine .
14765563	1	58	Although the United States Food and Drug Administration banned its use for nocturnal leg cramps due to lack of safety and efficacy , quinine is widely available in beverages including tonic water and bitter lemon .
14765563	2	271	Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that products containing quinine may produce neurological complications , including confusion , altered mental status , seizures , and coma , particularly in older women .
14765563	3	472	Psychologists need to inquire about consumption of quinine - containing beverages as part of an evaluation process .
14976857	0	0	Transient platypnea - orthodeoxia - like syndrome induced by propafenone overdose in a young woman with Ebstein ' s anomaly .
14976857	1	119	In this report we describe the case of a 37 - year - old white woman with Ebstein ' s anomaly , who developed a rare syndrome called platypnea - orthodeoxia , characterized by massive right - to - left interatrial shunting with transient profound hypoxia and cyanosis .
14976857	2	374	This shunt of blood via a patent foramen ovale occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure , and was probably precipitated by a propafenone overdose .
14976857	3	542	This drug caused biventricular dysfunction , due to its negative inotropic effect , and hypotension , due to its peripheral vasodilatory effect .
14976857	4	684	These effects gave rise to an increase in the right atrial pressure and a decrease in the left one with a consequent stretching of the foramen ovale and the creation of massive right - to - left shunting .
14976857	5	885	In our case this interatrial shunt was very accurately detected at bubble contrast echocardiography .
15009014	0	0	Noxious chemical stimulation of rat facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow through a trigemino - parasympathetic reflex - - an experimental model for vascular dysfunctions in cluster headache .
15009014	1	197	Cluster headache is characterized by typical autonomic dysfunctions including facial and intracranial vascular disturbances .
15009014	2	322	Both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions .
15009014	3	431	An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa .
15009014	4	597	Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry .
15009014	5	723	Capsaicin ( 0 . 01 - 1 mm ) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced increases in dural and cortical blood flow and provoked lacrimation .
15009014	6	854	These responses were blocked by systemic pre - administration of hexamethonium chloride ( 20 mg / kg ) .
15009014	7	952	The evoked increases in dural blood flow were also abolished by topical pre - administration of atropine ( 1 mm ) and [ Lys1 , Pro2 , 5 , Arg3 , 4 , Tyr6 ] - VIP ( 0 . 1 mm ) , a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) antagonist , onto the exposed dura mater .
15009014	8	1192	We conclude that noxious stimulation of facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow and lacrimation via a trigemino - parasympathetic reflex .
15009014	9	1336	The blood flow responses seem to be mediated by the release of acetylcholine and VIP within the meninges .
15009014	10	1442	Similar mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of cluster headache .
15036754	0	0	Organophosphate - induced convulsions and prevention of neuropathological damages .
15036754	1	81	Such organophosphorus ( OP ) compounds as diisopropylfluorophosphate ( DFP ) , sarin and soman are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases ( AChEs ) and butyrylcholinesterases ( BChEs ) .
15036754	2	262	The acute toxicity of OPs is the result of their irreversible binding with AChEs in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , which elevates acetylcholine ( ACh ) levels .
15036754	3	423	The protective action of subcutaneously ( SC ) administered antidotes or their combinations in DFP ( 2 . 0 mg / kg BW ) intoxication was studied in 9 - 10 - weeks - old Han - Wistar male rats .
15036754	4	600	The rats received AChE reactivator pralidoxime - 2 - chloride ( 2PAM ) ( 30 . 0 mg / kg BW ) , anticonvulsant diazepam ( 2 . 0 mg / kg BW ) , A ( 1 ) - adenosine receptor agonist N ( 6 ) - cyclopentyl adenosine ( CPA ) ( 2 . 0 mg / kg BW ) , NMDA - receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate ( + - MK801 hydrogen maleate ) ( 2 . 0 mg / kg BW ) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug atropine sulfate ( 50 . 0 mg / kg BW ) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of DFP .
15036754	5	1028	The control rats received atropine sulfate , but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and DFP , respectively .
15036754	6	1152	All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the DFP injection .
15036754	7	1225	The rats treated with DFP - atropine showed severe typical OP - induced toxicity signs .
15036754	8	1309	When CPA , diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP - atropine , these treatments prevented , delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning .
15036754	9	1473	Atropine - MK801 did not offer any additional protection against DFP toxicity .
15036754	10	1550	In conclusion , CPA , diazepam and 2PAM in combination with atropine prevented the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning and thus reduced the toxicity of DFP in rat .
150790	0	0	A pyridoxine - dependent behavioral disorder unmasked by isoniazid .
150790	1	66	A 3 - year - old girl had behavioral deterioration , with hyperkinesis , irritability , and sleeping difficulties after the therapeutic administration of isoniazid .
150790	2	224	The administration of pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine hydrochloride led to a disappearance of symptoms .
150790	3	330	After discontinuing isoniazid therapy a similar pattern of behavior was noted that was controlled by pyridoxine .
150790	4	443	A placebo had no effect , but niacinamide was as effective as pyridoxine .
150790	5	516	Periodic withdrawal of pyridoxine was associated with return of the hyperkinesis .
150790	6	598	The level of pyridoxal in the blood was normal during the periods of relapse .
150790	7	676	Metabolic studies suggested a block in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism .
150790	8	764	The patient has been followed for six years and has required pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine to control her behavior .
15120741	0	0	Recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus of a murine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
15120741	1	87	Similar to rats , systemic pilocarpine injection causes status epilepticus ( SE ) and the eventual development of spontaneous seizures and mossy fiber sprouting in C57BL / 6 and CD1 mice , but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice .
15120741	2	353	Population responses in granule cells of the dentate gyrus were examined in transverse slices of the ventral hippocampus from pilocarpine - treated and untreated mice .
15120741	3	519	In Mg ( 2 + ) - free bathing medium containing bicuculline , conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices , electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a single population spike in granule cells from control mice and pilocarpine - treated mice that did not experience SE .
15120741	4	799	In SE survivors , similar stimulation resulted in a population spike followed , at a variable latency , by negative DC shifts and repetitive afterdischarges of 3 - 60 s duration , which were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists .
15120741	5	1038	Focal glutamate photostimulation of the granule cell layer at sites distant from the recording pipette resulted in population responses of 1 - 30 s duration in slices from SE survivors but not other groups .
15120741	6	1243	These data support the hypothesis that SE - induced mossy fiber sprouting and synaptic reorganization are relevant characteristics of seizure development in these murine strains , resembling rat models of human temporal lobe epilepsy .
15130900	0	0	Urinary bladder cancer in Wegener ' s granulomatosis : risks and relation to cyclophosphamide .
15130900	1	92	OBJECTIVE : To assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer , and its relation to cyclophosphamide , in patients with Wegener ' s granulomatosis .
15130900	2	239	METHODS : In the population based , nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener ' s granulomatosis , 1969 - 95 , was identified .
15130900	3	393	Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register , all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified .
15130900	4	518	Nested within the cohort , a matched case - control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios ( ORs ) as relative risk .
15130900	5	701	In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener ' s granulomatosis , and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis , were also estimated .
15130900	6	919	RESULTS : The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases ( n = 11 ) and controls ( n = 25 ) were 113 g and 25 g , respectively .
15130900	7	1054	The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide ( OR = 2 . 0 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0 . 8 to 4 . 9 ) .
15130900	8	1187	Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk ( OR = 7 . 7 , 95 % CI 0 . 9 to 69 ) .
15130900	9	1303	The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10 % 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis , and a history of bladder cancer was ( non - significantly ) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis .
15130900	10	1558	CONCLUSION : The results indicate a dose - response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer , high cumulative risks in the entire cohort , and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before Wegener ' s granulomatosis .
15145918	0	0	Differential modulation by estrogen of alpha2 - adrenergic and I1 - imidazoline receptor - mediated hypotension in female rats .
15145918	1	122	We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine ( mixed alpha2 - / I1 - receptor agonist ) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction .
15145918	2	340	The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2 - and / or I1 - receptors .
15145918	3	458	Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine ( 600 microg / kg ) or alpha - methyldopa ( 100 mg / kg ) , selective I1 - and alpha2 - receptor agonists , respectively , in blood pressure , hemodynamic variability , and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham - operated and ovariectomized ( Ovx ) Sprague - Dawley female rats with or without 12 - wk estrogen replacement .
15145918	4	844	Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed : the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat - to - beat intervals ( SDRR ) and the root mean square of successive differences in R - wave - to - R - wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability .
15145918	5	1184	In sham - operated rats , rilmenidine or alpha - methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure .
15145918	6	1377	SDRR was reduced only by alpha - methyldopa .
15145918	7	1420	Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha - methyldopa , in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension .
15145918	8	1546	The enhanced alpha - methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity .
15145918	9	1680	Estrogen replacement ( 17beta - estradiol subcutaneous pellet , 14 . 2 microg / day , 12 wk ) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha - methyldopa to sham - operated levels .
15145918	10	1868	These findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2 - but not I1 - receptor - mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha - methyldopa - estrogen interaction .
15188772	0	0	Severe reversible left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to accidental iatrogenic epinephrine overdose .
15188772	1	121	Catecholamine - induced cardiomyopathy due to chronic excess of endogenous catecholamines has been recognized for decades as a clinical phenomenon .
15188772	2	267	In contrast , reports of myocardial dysfunction due to acute iatrogenic overdose are rare .
15188772	3	357	A 35 - year - old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of epinephrine developed myocardial stunning that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise , profound , albeit transient , left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction , and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis .
15188772	4	687	Our case illustrates the serious consequences of medical errors that can be avoided through improved medication labeling and staff supervision .
15233872	0	0	Cardioprotective effect of tincture of Crataegus on isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
15233872	1	105	Tincture of Crataegus ( TCR ) , an alcoholic extract of the berries of hawthorn ( Crataegus oxycantha ) , is used in herbal and homeopathic medicine .
15233872	2	249	The present study was done to investigate the protective effect of TCR on experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats .
15233872	3	377	Pretreatment of TCR , at a dose of 0 . 5 mL / 100 g bodyweight per day , orally for 30 days , prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and activity of marker enzymes observed in isoproterenol - induced rats ( 85 mg kg ( - 1 ) s . c . for 2 days at an interval of 24 h ) .
15233872	4	635	TCR prevented the isoproterenol - induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the rate of ADP - stimulated oxygen uptake and respiratory coupling ratio .
15233872	5	807	TCR protected against pathological changes induced by isoproterenol in rat heart .
15233872	6	889	The results show that pretreatment with TCR may be useful in preventing the damage induced by isoproterenol in rat heart .
1527456	0	0	Treatment of tinnitus by intratympanic instillation of lignocaine ( lidocaine ) 2 per cent through ventilation tubes .
1527456	1	116	Idiopathic subjective tinnitus ( IST ) is one of the most obscure otological pathologies .
1527456	2	204	This paper presents the results of treating IST by intratympanic instillation of lignocaine ( lidocaine ) 2 per cent through a grommet , for five weekly courses .
1527456	3	363	Fifty - two patients suffering from intractable tinnitus entered this therapeutic trial , but only nine finished all five courses .
1527456	4	491	In one patient , the tinnitus was almost completely abolished , but in all the nine patients the decompensated tinnitus changed to a compensated one .
1527456	5	639	We suggest this mode of treatment for patients that were previously treated by drugs , acupuncture and biofeedback , with disappointing results .
1527456	6	782	Patients should be warned about the side effects of vertigo and vomiting , which subsides gradually with every new instillation , and that the tinnitus may not disappear but will be alleviated , enabling them to cope more easily with the disease and lead a more normal life .
15275829	0	0	The alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits are necessary for nicotine - induced seizures and hypolocomotion in mice .
15275829	1	135	Binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) elicits a series of dose - dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration , sedation , and tremors , to seizures and death .
15275829	2	326	nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits .
15275829	3	406	A gene cluster comprises the alpha3 , alpha5 and beta4 subunits , which coassemble to form functional receptors .
15275829	4	517	We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine - induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null ( beta4 - / - ) and alpha3 heterozygous ( + / - ) mice . beta4 - / - mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses , measured as decreased exploration in an open field , and at high doses , measured as sensitivity to nicotine - induced seizures .
15275829	5	887	Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits , we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged , whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb , and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 - / - brains . alpha3 + / - mice were partially resistant to nicotine - induced seizures when compared to wild - type littermates .
15275829	6	1284	mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 + / - brains .
15275829	7	1371	Together , these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of nicotine - induced seizures and hypolocomotion .
15278670	0	0	The effects of sevoflurane on lidocaine - induced convulsions .
15278670	1	61	The influence of sevoflurane on lidocaine - induced convulsions was studied in cats .
15278670	2	144	The convulsive threshold ( mean + / - SD ) was 41 . 4 + / - 6 . 5 mg . l ( - 1 ) with lidocaine infusion ( 6 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . min ( - 1 ) ) , increasing significantly to 66 . 6 + / - 10 . 9 mg . l ( - 1 ) when the end - tidal concentration of sevoflurane was 0 . 8 % .
15278670	3	367	However , the threshold ( 61 . 6 + / - 8 . 7 mg . l ( - 1 ) ) during 1 . 6 % sevoflurane was not significant from that during 0 . 8 % sevoflurane , indicating a celling effect .
15278670	4	523	There was no significant difference in the convulsive threshold between sevoflurane and enflurane .
15278670	5	622	The rise in blood pressure became less marked when higher concentrations of sevoflurane or enflurane were administered and the blood pressure at convulsions decreased significantly in 1 . 6 % sevoflurane , and in 0 . 8 % and 1 . 6 % enflurane .
15278670	6	856	However , there was no significant difference in the lidocaine concentrations measured when the systolic blood pressure became 70 mmHg .
15278670	7	991	Apamin , a selective blocker of calcium - dependent potassium channels , was administered intracerebroventricularly in rats anesthetized with 0 . 8 % sevoflurane to investigate the mechanism of the anticonvulsive effects .
15278670	8	1206	Apamin ( 10 ng ) had a tendency to decrease the convulsive threshold ( 21 . 6 + / - 2 . 2 to 19 . 9 + / - 2 . 5 mg . l ( - 1 ) ) but this was not statistically significant .
15278670	9	1358	It is suggested that sevoflurane reduces the convulsive effect of lidocaine toxicity but carries some risk due to circulatory depression .
15325671	0	0	Cardiac toxicity observed in association with high - dose cyclophosphamide - based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer .
15325671	1	122	INTRODUCTION : Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens .
15325671	2	239	In high doses , its nonhematological dose - limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy .
15325671	3	317	STUDY DESIGN : We combined paclitaxel , melphalan and high - dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin in a triple sequential high - dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer .
15325671	4	508	Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy - responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96 - h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high - dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and the following pretreatment characteristics : presence of electrocardiogram ( EKG ) abnormalities , age , hypertension , prior cardiac history , smoking , diabetes mellitus , prior use of anthracyclines , and left - sided chest irradiation .
15325671	5	1009	RESULTS : Six of 61 women ( 10 % ) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31 % .
15325671	6	1181	Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide - related cardiac toxicity ( 10 % ) is comparable to previous recorded literature .
15325671	7	1299	Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development ; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59 , respectively .
15325671	8	1462	No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics .
15325671	9	1528	CONCLUSIONS : As a result of these findings , oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients .
15325671	10	1642	Routine EKG monitoring during infusional cyclophosphamide did not predict CHF development .
15338796	0	0	Tremor side effects of salbutamol , quantified by a laser pointer technique .
15338796	1	76	OBJECTIVE : To study tremor side effects of salbutamol an easily applicable , quick and low - priced method is needed .
15338796	2	191	A new method using a commercially available , pen - shaped laser pointer was developed .
15338796	3	276	Aim of the study was to determine sensitivity , reproducibility , reference values and the agreement with a questionnaire .
15338796	4	397	METHODS : Tremor was measured using a laser pointer technique .
15338796	5	459	To determine sensitivity we assessed tremor in 44 patients with obstructive lung disease after administration of cumulative doses of salbutamol .
15338796	6	604	Subjects were asked to aim at the centre of a target , subdivided in concentric circles , from 5 m distance .
15338796	7	711	The circle in which the participant succeeded to aim was recorded in millimetres radius .
15338796	8	800	In another series of measurements , reproducibility and reference values of the tremor was assessed in 65 healthy subjects in three sessions , at 9 a . m . , 4 p . m . and 9 a . m . , respectively , 1 week later .
15338796	9	999	Postural tremor was measured with the arm horizontally outstretched rest tremor with the arm supported by an armrest and finally tremor was measured after holding a 2 - kg weight until exhaustion .
15338796	10	1194	Inter - observer variability was measured in a series of 10 healthy subjects .
15338796	11	1270	Tremor was measured simultaneously by two independent observers .
15338796	12	1335	RESULTS : Salbutamol significantly increased tremor severity in patients in a dose - dependent way .
15338796	13	1432	Within healthy adults no age - dependency could be found ( b = 0 . 262 mm / year ; P = 0 . 72 ) .
15338796	14	1518	There was no agreement between the questionnaire and tremor severity ( r = 0 . 093 ; P = 0 . 53 ) .
15338796	15	1610	Postural tremor showed no significant difference between the first and third session ( P = 0 . 07 ) .
15338796	16	1707	Support of the arm decreased tremor severity , exhaustion increased tremor severity significantly .
15338796	17	1805	A good agreement was found between two independent observers ( interclass correlation coefficient 0 . 72 ) .
15338796	18	1909	DISCUSSION : Quantifying tremor by using an inexpensive laser pointer is , with the exception of children ( < 12 years ) a sensitive and reproducible method .
15458908	0	0	Safety and adverse effects associated with raloxifene : multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation .
15458908	1	99	OBJECTIVE : To examine the effect of raloxifene on major adverse events that occur with postmenopausal estrogen therapy or tamoxifen .
15458908	2	232	METHODS : The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation , a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial , enrolled 7 , 705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis .
15458908	3	391	Women were randomly assigned to raloxifene 60 mg / d or 120 mg / d or placebo .
15458908	4	466	Outcomes included venous thromboembolism , cataracts , gallbladder disease , and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer .
15458908	5	579	RESULTS : During a mean follow - up of 3 . 3 years , raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism ( relative risk [ RR ] 2 . 1 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 2 - 3 . 8 ) .
15458908	6	766	The excess event rate was 1 . 8 per 1 , 000 woman - years ( 95 % CI - 0 . 5 - 4 . 1 ) , and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 ( 95 % CI 100 - 582 ) over 3 . 3 years .
15458908	7	926	Risk in the raloxifene group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years , but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter .
15458908	8	1088	Raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts ( RR 0 . 9 ; 95 % CI 0 . 8 - 1 . 1 ) , gallbladder disease ( RR 1 . 0 ; 95 % CI 0 . 7 - 1 . 3 ) , endometrial hyperplasia ( RR 1 . 3 ; 95 % CI 0 . 4 - 5 . 1 ) , or endometrial cancer ( RR 0 . 9 ; 95 % CI 0 . 3 - 2 . 7 ) .
15458908	9	1305	CONCLUSION : Raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism , but there was no increased risk for cataracts , gallbladder disease , endometrial hyperplasia , or endometrial cancer .
15458908	10	1510	LEVEL OF EVIDENCE : I
1549199	0	0	Optimization of levodopa therapy .
1549199	1	34	While there is no single correct starting dose for levodopa therapy , many individuals can be started on either the 25 / 100 or controlled - release formula , following the general rule not to attempt to titrate carbidopa - levodopa to the point of " normality , " which can lead to toxicity .
1549199	2	316	The physician should also determine the proper use of any adjunctive medications ; such combined therapy has become the standard approach to treatment .
1549199	3	467	Following the initial period of therapy , emerging difficulties require a reassessment of therapeutic approaches , such as dosage adjustment or introduction of a dopamine agonist .
1549199	4	645	Other possible adverse effects - - such as gastrointestinal disorders , orthostatic hypotension , levodopa - induced psychosis , sleep disturbances or parasomnias , or drug interactions - - also require carefully monitored individual treatment .
1549199	5	878	Nonpharmacologic concerns can help the Parkinson ' s disease patient achieve and maintain optimal functioning , including daily exercise , physical therapy , and involvement with support groups .
15515654	0	0	Long term audiological evaluation of beta - thalassemic patients .
15515654	1	64	OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to identify the incidence and to monitor the progression of hearing loss in children and young adults with beta - thalassemia major .
15515654	2	238	METHODS : One hundred and four ( 104 ) patients aged 6 - 35 years ( mean 17 , 2 years ) participated in the study .
15515654	3	344	All patients were on a regular transfusion - chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9 . 5 gr / dl .
15515654	4	455	Subjects were receiving desferrioxamine ( DFO ) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50 - 60 mg / kg , 5 - 6 days a week during the first six years of the study , which was then reduced to 40 - 50 mg / kg for the following eight years .
15515654	5	686	Patients were followed for 8 - 14 years .
15515654	6	725	RESULTS : Overall , 21 out of 104 patients ( 20 . 2 % ) presented with high frequency sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) , either unilateral or bilateral .
15515654	7	871	No ototoxic factor , other than DFO , was present in any of the patients .
15515654	8	943	Patients with SNHL presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing , however , no statistically significant difference was observed .
15515654	9	1111	Subjects with SNHL were submitted to DFO reduction or temporary withdrawal .
15515654	10	1187	Following intervention , 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered , 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation .
15515654	11	1303	CONCLUSION : The findings are indicative of DFO ' s contributing role in the development of hearing impairment .
15515654	12	1412	Regular audiologic evaluation is imperative in all thalassemic patients so that early changes may be recognized and treatment may be judiciously adjusted in order to prevent or reverse hearing impairment .
15572383	0	0	Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin - induced renal damage .
15572383	1	120	BACKGROUND : In man , differences in angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) levels , related to ACE ( I / D ) genotype , are associated with renal prognosis .
15572383	2	267	This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage .
15572383	3	402	Therefore , we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats .
15572383	4	554	METHODS : Renal ACE activity ( Hip - His - Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates ) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats .
15572383	5	690	After 1 week of recovery , proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [ 1 . 5 mg / kg intravenously ( i . v . ) n = 18 ; controls , saline i . v . n = 9 ] .
15572383	6	824	Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks .
15572383	7	864	After 12 weeks , rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested .
15572383	8	930	RESULTS : As anticipated , adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria , renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis .
15572383	9	1065	Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin ( r = 0 . 62 , P < 0 . 01 ) , renal interstitial alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 49 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial macrophage influx ( r = 0 . 56 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial collagen III ( r = 0 . 53 , P < 0 . 05 ) , glomerular alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 74 , P < 0 . 01 ) and glomerular desmin ( r = 0 . 48 , P < 0 . 05 ) .
15572383	10	1441	Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis ( r = 0 . 22 , NS ) .
15572383	11	1524	In controls , no predictive values for renal parameters were observed .
15572383	12	1594	CONCLUSION : Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin - induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain .
15572383	13	1735	This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage .
15602202	0	0	Recurrent acute interstitial nephritis induced by azithromycin .
15602202	1	64	A 14 - year - old girl is reported with recurrent , azithromycin - induced , acute interstitial nephritis .
15602202	2	163	The second episode was more severe than the first ; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy , renal function remained impaired .
15602202	3	318	Although most cases of antibiotic induced acute interstitial nephritis are benign and self - limited , some patients are at risk for permanent renal injury .
15632880	0	0	Spironolactone - induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure .
15632880	1	92	BACKGROUND : A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia ( 2 % ) and renal insufficiency ( 0 % ) .
15632880	2	277	Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported , the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice .
15632880	3	458	We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone .
15632880	4	627	METHODS : We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice .
15632880	5	750	Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia ( K ( + ) > 5 . 0 mEq / L ) or renal insufficiency ( Cr > or = 2 . 5 mg / dL ) , and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case .
15632880	6	923	Clinical characteristics , medications , and serum chemistries at baseline and follow - up time periods were compared .
15632880	7	1038	RESULTS : Sixty - seven of 926 patients ( 7 . 2 % ) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia ( n = 33 ) or renal failure ( n = 34 ) .
15632880	8	1181	Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes , had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses , and were more likely to be treated with beta - blockers than controls ( n = 134 ) .
15632880	9	1431	Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine , required higher doses of loop diuretics , and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls .
15632880	10	1658	CONCLUSIONS : Spironolactone - induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously .
15632880	11	1800	This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta - blockers .
15649445	0	0	Acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial dyskinesia in rats .
15649445	1	138	Reserpine - and haloperidol - induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress .
15649445	2	336	In the present study , the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats .
15649445	3	469	Reserpine injection ( one dose of 1 mg / kg s . c . ) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing , tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching , compared to the control .
15649445	4	670	Haloperidol administration ( one dose of 12 mg / kg once a week s . c . ) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing , tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations .
15649445	5	876	After the treatments and behavioral observation , glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed .
15649445	6	981	A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol , compared to the control .
15649445	7	1124	Importantly , a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia .
15649445	8	1249	These results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats .
15737522	0	0	Ceftriaxone - associated biliary pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients .
15737522	1	80	It is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients .
15737522	2	157	Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction , such as fasting , may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis .
15737522	3	326	In this study , we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment , who often had to fast in the post - operative period .
15737522	4	542	Fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms .
15737522	5	630	Of those , 13 ( 26 % ) developed biliary pathology .
15737522	6	678	Comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age , sex , duration of the treatment and starvation variables .
15737522	7	850	After cessation of the treatment , pseudolithiasis resolved spontaneously within a short period .
15737522	8	946	The incidence of pseudolithiasis is not affected by fasting .
15804801	0	0	Coronary aneurysm after implantation of a paclitaxel - eluting stent .
15804801	1	68	Formation of coronary aneurysm is a rare complication of stenting with bare metal stents , but based on experimental studies drug - eluting stents may induce toxic effects on the vessel wall with incomplete stent apposition , aneurysm formation and with the potential of stent thrombosis or vessel rupture .
15804801	2	371	We present a 43 - year - old man who developed a coronary aneurysm in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a paclitaxel - eluting stent .
15804801	3	516	The patient was asymptomatic and the aneurysm was detected in a routine control .
15804801	4	597	Angiography and intracoronary ultrasound demonstrated lack of contact between stent and vessel wall in a 15 - mm long segment with maximal aneurysm diameter of 6 . 0 mm .
15804801	5	763	The patient was successfully treated with a graft stent .
15859940	0	0	Causes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy in patients receiving kidney transplantation .
15859940	1	89	OBJECTIVES : Thrombotic microangiopathy is a well - known problem in patients following renal transplantation .
15859940	2	197	In postrenal transplantation , thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome .
15859940	3	306	We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature .
15859940	4	449	MATERIALS AND METHODS : We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1 - year period , from June 2003 to June 2004 , at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies ( n = 25 ) performed during this interval .
15859940	5	739	Pre - and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible .
15859940	6	801	RESULTS : Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found .
15859940	7	863	Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital , while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow - up .
15859940	8	1067	Three cases were related to cyclosporine , and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus .
15859940	9	1171	The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus .
15859940	10	1317	CONCLUSIONS : In the literature , the most - frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome .
15859940	11	1494	Other causes include drug - related ( cyclosporine , tacrolimus ) toxicity , procoagulant status , and antibody - mediated rejection .
15859940	12	1619	We found that the most - frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related , secondary mainly to cyclosporine .
15859940	13	1739	In the current study , the frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy was similar to the percentage reported in the literature ( 20 % ) .
15863244	0	0	Comparison of developmental toxicity of selective and non - selective cyclooxygenase - 2 inhibitors in CRL : ( WI ) WUBR Wistar rats - - DFU and piroxicam study .
15863244	1	150	BACKGROUND : Cyclooxygenase ( COX ) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy .
15863244	2	253	Unlike general toxicity data , their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before .
15863244	3	349	The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non - selective ( piroxicam ) and selective ( DFU ; 5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5H ) - furanon ) COX - 2 inhibitors .
15863244	4	565	METHODS : Drugs were separately , orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 ( GD1 = plug day ) .
15863244	5	671	Doses were set at 0 . 3 , 3 . 0 and 30 . 0mg / kg for piroxicam and 0 . 2 , 2 . 0 and 20 . 0mg / kg for DFU .
15863244	6	762	Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined .
15863244	7	818	Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done .
15863244	8	883	The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal ( VSD ) and midline ( MD ) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam , selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitor based on present and historic data .
15863244	9	1101	RESULTS : Maternal toxicity , intrauterine growth retardation , and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam .
15863244	10	1274	Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose .
15863244	11	1407	Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU - exposed groups .
15863244	12	1477	Prenatal exposure to non - selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX - 2 inhibitors .
15863244	13	1635	CONCLUSION : Both selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose .
15863244	14	1764	Unlike DFU , piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams .
15863244	15	1821	Prenatal exposure to selective COX - 2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non - selective drugs and historic control .
15899738	0	0	Lone atrial fibrillation associated with creatine monohydrate supplementation .
15899738	1	79	Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare .
15899738	2	159	Therefore , when the arrhythmia is present in this population , reversible causes must be identified and resolved .
15899738	3	272	Thyroid disorders , illicit drug or stimulant use , and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes .
15899738	4	377	We report the case of a 30 - year - old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .
15899738	5	520	His medical history was unremarkable , except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot .
15899738	6	610	Thyroid - stimulating hormone , magnesium , and potassium levels were within normal limits , urine drug screen was negative , and alcohol use was denied .
15899738	7	758	However , when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements , the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed .
15899738	8	891	The patient was admitted to the hospital , anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin , and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control .
15899738	9	1082	When discharged less than 24 hours later , he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin , with follow - up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion .
15899738	10	1248	Exogenous creatine is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance .
15899738	11	1334	Vegetarians may also take creatine to replace what they are not consuming from meat , fish , and other animal products .
15899738	12	1452	Previous anecdotal reports have linked creatine to the development of arrhythmia .
15899738	13	1534	Clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements .
15899738	14	1706	In addition , it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the Food and Drug Administration and in the literature .
1592014	0	0	Seizures induced by the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine in rats .
1592014	1	68	The half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of cocaine is relatively short , but some of the consequences of its use , such as seizures and strokes , can occur hours after exposure .
1592014	2	224	This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae .
1592014	3	335	We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine , benzoylecgonine ( BE ) , to cause seizures .
1592014	4	439	Two separate equimolar doses ( 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mumol ) of either cocaine or BE were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats .
1592014	5	573	Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence , latency , and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seizures .
1592014	6	705	BE - Induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of cocaine .
1592014	7	841	Whereas cocaine - induced seizures were best characterized as brief , generalized , and tonic and resulted in death , those induced by BE were prolonged , often multiple and mixed in type , and rarely resulted in death .
1592014	8	1054	Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expression .
1592014	9	1190	BE - Injected rats that did not have seizures had significantly more locomotor activity than cocaine - injected animals without seizures .
1592014	10	1324	The finding that cocaine - and BE - induced seizures differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for cocaine - induced seizures and emphasizes the importance of a cocaine metabolite , BE .
15957009	0	0	The selective 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist Ro4368554 restores memory performance in cholinergic and serotonergic models of memory deficiency in the rat .
15957009	1	150	Antagonists at serotonin type 6 ( 5 - HT ( 6 ) ) receptors show activity in models of learning and memory .
15957009	2	250	Although the underlying mechanism ( s ) are not well understood , these effects may involve an increase in acetylcholine ( ACh ) levels .
15957009	3	381	The present study sought to characterize the cognitive - enhancing effects of the 5 - HT ( 6 ) antagonist Ro4368554 ( 3 - benzenesulfonyl - 7 - ( 4 - methyl - piperazin - 1 - yl ) 1H - indole ) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic ( scopolamine pretreatment ) and a serotonergic - ( tryptophan ( TRP ) depletion ) deficient model , and compared its pattern of action with that of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor metrifonate .
15957009	4	793	Initial testing in a time - dependent forgetting task employing a 24 - h delay between training and testing showed that metrifonate improved object recognition ( at 10 and 30 mg / kg , p . o . ) , whereas Ro4368554 was inactive .
15957009	5	1009	Both , Ro4368554 ( 3 and 10 mg / kg , intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) ) and metrifonate ( 10 mg / kg , p . o . , respectively ) reversed memory deficits induced by scopolamine and TRP depletion ( 10 mg / kg , i . p . , and 3 mg / kg , p . o . , respectively ) .
15957009	6	1232	In conclusion , although Ro4368554 did not improve a time - related retention deficit , it reversed a cholinergic and a serotonergic memory deficit , suggesting that both mechanisms may be involved in the facilitation of object memory by Ro4368554 and , possibly , other 5 - HT ( 6 ) receptor antagonists .
16005948	0	0	Evaluation of the anticocaine monoclonal antibody GNC92H2 as an immunotherapy for cocaine overdose .
16005948	1	100	The illicit use of cocaine continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for cocaine overdose remains elusive .
16005948	2	213	Current protein - based technology offers a new therapeutic venue by which antibodies bind the drug in the blood stream , inactivating its toxic effects .
16005948	3	364	The therapeutic potential of the anticocaine antibody GNC92H2 was examined using a model of cocaine overdose .
16005948	4	474	Swiss albino mice prepared with intrajugular catheters were tested in photocell cages after administration of 93 mg / kg ( LD50 ) of cocaine and GNC92H2 infusions ranging from 30 to 190 mg / kg .
16005948	5	663	GNC92H2 was delivered 30 min before , concomitantly or 3 min after cocaine treatment .
16005948	6	748	Significant blockade of cocaine toxicity was observed with the higher dose of GNC92H2 ( 190 mg / kg ) , where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40 % , seizures up to 77 % and death by 72 % .
16005948	7	934	Importantly , GNC92H2 prevented death even post - cocaine injection .
16005948	8	1000	The results support the important potential of GNC92H2 as a therapeutic tool against cocaine overdose .
1601297	0	0	Electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial injury in psychiatrically hospitalized cocaine abusers .
1601297	1	100	The electrocardiograms ( ECG ) of 99 cocaine - abusing patients were compared with the ECGs of 50 schizophrenic controls .
1601297	2	218	Eleven of the cocaine abusers and none of the controls had ECG evidence of significant myocardial injury defined as myocardial infarction , ischemia , and bundle branch block .
16160878	0	0	Behavioral effects of urotensin - II centrally administered in mice .
16160878	1	67	Urotensin - II ( U - II ) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system .
16160878	2	151	Intracerebroventricular ( i . c . v . ) injection of U - II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion .
16160878	3	290	However , the behavioral effects of centrally administered U - II have received little attention .
16160878	4	385	In the present study , we tested the effects of i . c . v . injections of U - II on behavioral , metabolic , and endocrine responses in mice .
16160878	5	517	Administration of graded doses of U - II ( 1 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse ) provoked : ( 1 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole - board test ; ( 2 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black - and - white compartment test , and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus - maze test ; and ( 3 ) a dose - dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced - swimming test and tail suspension test .
16160878	6	994	Intracerebroventricular injection of U - II also caused an increase in : food intake at doses of 100 and 1 , 000 ng / mouse , water intake at doses of 100 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse , and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10 , 000 ng / mouse .
16160878	7	1223	Whatever was the dose , the central administration of U - II had no effect on body temperature , nociception , apomorphine - induced penile erection and climbing behavior , and stress - induced plasma corticosterone level .
16160878	8	1436	Taken together , the present study demonstrates that the central injection of U - II at doses of 1 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse induces anxiogenic - and depressant - like effects in mouse .
16160878	9	1606	These data suggest that U - II may be involved in some aspects of psychiatric disorders .
1616457	0	0	Learning of rats under amnesia caused by pentobarbital .
1616457	1	56	Dissociated learning of rats in the normal state and the state of amnesia produced by pentobarbital ( 15 mg / kg , ip ) was carried out .
1616457	2	188	Rats were trained to approach a shelf where they received food reinforcement .
1616457	3	266	In Group 1 the rats were trained under the influence of pentobarbital to run to the same shelf as in the normal state .
1616457	4	385	In Group 2 the rats were trained to approach different shelves in different drug states .
1616457	5	474	It was shown that memory dissociation occurred in both groups .
1616457	6	537	Differences in the parameters of training under the influence of pentobarbital between Groups 1 and 2 were revealed .
1616457	7	654	These findings show that the brain - dissociated state induced by pentobarbital is formed with the participation of the mechanisms of information perception .
16167916	0	0	The effects of short - term raloxifene therapy on fibrinolysis markers : TAFI , tPA , and PAI - 1 .
16167916	1	92	BACKGROUND : Markers of fibrinolysis , thrombin - activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor ( TAFI ) , tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , and plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( PAI - 1 ) levels were studied for the evaluation of short - term effects of raloxifene administration in postmenopausal women .
16167916	2	383	METHODS : Thirty - nine postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective , controlled clinical study .
16167916	3	519	Twenty - five women were given raloxifene hydrochloride ( 60 mg / day ) plus calcium ( 500 mg / day ) .
16167916	4	612	Age - matched controls ( n = 14 ) were given only calcium .
16167916	5	667	Plasma TAFI , tPA , and PAI - 1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits .
16167916	6	806	Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon ' s test .
16167916	7	866	Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated .
16167916	8	952	RESULTS : Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations ( 16 % change , P < 0 . 01 ) , and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations ( 25 % change , P < 0 . 05 ) .
16167916	9	1188	A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of amenorrhea ( P < 0 . 05 ; r = 0 . 33 ) .
16167916	10	1322	CONCLUSION : We suggest that the increased risk of venous thromboembolism due to raloxifene treatment may be related to increased tPA levels , but not TAFI levels .
16181582	0	0	Valproate - induced encephalopathy .
16181582	1	34	Valproate - induced encephalopathy is a rare syndrome that may manifest in otherwise normal epileptic individuals .
16181582	2	147	It may even present in patients who have tolerated this medicine well in the past .
16181582	3	230	It is usually but not necessarily associated with hyperammonemia .
16181582	4	296	The EEG shows characteristic triphasic waves in most patients with this complication .
16181582	5	382	A case of valproate - induced encephalopathy is presented .
16181582	6	439	The problems in diagnosing this condition are subsequently discussed .
16274958	0	0	Recurrent dysphonia and acitretin .
16274958	1	35	We report the case of a woman complaining of dysphonia while she was treated by acitretin .
16274958	2	126	Her symptoms totally regressed after drug withdrawal and reappeared when acitretin was reintroduced .
16274958	3	227	To our knowledge , this is the first case of acitretin - induced dysphonia .
16274958	4	300	This effect may be related to the pharmacological effect of this drug on mucous membranes .
16298782	0	0	Nitro - L - arginine methyl ester : a potential protector against gentamicin ototoxicity .
16298782	1	85	The nitric oxide ( NO ) inhibitor nitro - L - arginine methyl ester ( L - NAME ) may act as an otoprotectant against high - frequency hearing loss caused by gentamicin , but further studies are needed to confirm this . Aminoglycoside antibiotics are still widely used by virtue of their efficacy and low cost .
16298782	2	380	Their ototoxicity is a serious health problem and , as their ototoxic mechanism involves the production of NO , we need to assess the use of NO inhibitors for the prevention of aminoglycoside - induced sensorineural hearing loss .
16298782	3	606	In this experimental study we used 30 Sprague - Dawley rats , 27 of which had gentamicin instilled into the middle ear .
16298782	4	723	The otoprotectant L - NAME was administered topically to 12 / 27 animals .
16298782	5	793	Its effect was determined in terms of attenuation of hearing loss , measured by shifts in the auditory brainstem response threshold .
16298782	6	925	L - NAME reduced gentamicin - induced hearing loss in the high - frequency range , but gave no protection in the middle or low frequencies .
16330293	0	0	Safety profile of a nicotine lozenge compared with that of nicotine gum in adult smokers with underlying medical conditions : a 12 - week , randomized , open - label study .
16330293	1	166	BACKGROUND : Nicotine polacrilex lozenges deliver 25 % to 27 % more nicotine compared with equivalent doses of nicotine polacrilex gum .
16330293	2	299	The increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum .
16330293	3	419	OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge and 4 - mg nicotine gum in smokers with selected label - restricted diseases .
16330293	4	596	METHODS : This was a multicenter , randomized , open - label study in adult smokers with heart disease , hypertension not controlled by medication , and / or diabetes mellitus .
16330293	5	764	Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge or 4 - mg nicotine gum .
16330293	6	863	Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 12 weeks after the start of product use .
16330293	7	965	RESULTS : Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment , 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum ( safety population ) .
16330293	8	1109	The majority were women ( 52 . 7 % ) .
16330293	9	1142	Patients ' mean age was 53 . 9 years , their mean weight was 193 . 9 pounds , and they smoked a mean of 25 . 2 cigarettes per day at baseline .
16330293	10	1276	Five hundred fifty - three patients , 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum , used the study product for > or = 4 days per week during the first 2 weeks ( evaluable population ) .
16330293	11	1456	The nicotine lozenge and nicotine gum were equally well tolerated , despite increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge .
16330293	12	1577	The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use ( evaluation population : 55 . 3 % lozenge , 54 . 7 % gum ) , as well as during the entire study ( safety population : 63 . 8 % and 58 . 6 % , respectively ) .
16330293	13	1815	Stratification of patients by sex , age , extent of concurrent smoking , extent of product use , and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum .
16330293	14	2015	The most common adverse events were nausea ( 17 . 2 % and 16 . 1 % ; 95 % CI , - 3 . 7 to 6 . 0 ) , hiccups ( 10 . 7 % and 6 . 6 % ; 95 % CI , 0 . 5 to 7 . 8 ) , and headache ( 8 . 7 % and 9 . 9 % ; 95 % Cl , - 5 . 0 to 2 . 6 ) .
16330293	15	2195	Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups .
16330293	16	2280	Fewer than 6 % of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study .
16330293	17	2431	The majority of patients ( > 60 % ) experienced no change in their disease status from baseline .
16330293	18	2524	CONCLUSION : The 4 - mg nicotine lozenge and 4 - mg nicotine gum had comparable safety profiles in these patients with label - restricted medical conditions .
16330766	0	0	Pharmacological modulation of pain - related brain activity during normal and central sensitization states in humans .
16330766	1	116	Abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system ( central sensitization ) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced pain sensitivity in the skin surrounding tissue injury ( secondary hyperalgesia ) .
16330766	2	340	Secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain .
16330766	3	459	Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization .
16330766	4	628	The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin , a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients , on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states .
16330766	5	829	Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in normal volunteers , we studied the gabapentin - induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia .
16330766	6	1076	The dose of gabapentin was 1 , 800 mg per os , in a single administration .
16330766	7	1148	We found that ( i ) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex , independently of the presence of central sensitization ; ( ii ) gabapentin reduced the activation in the brainstem , only during central sensitization ; ( iii ) gabapentin suppressed stimulus - induced deactivations , only during central sensitization ; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation .
16330766	8	1550	The observed drug - induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal .
16330766	9	1637	These findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation , thus supporting the concept that gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present .
16337777	0	0	Investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine .
16337777	1	105	Mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis , such as energy generation , control of cell death , neurotransmitter synthesis , and free radical ( FR ) production .
16337777	2	307	Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA - encoded subunits .
16337777	3	464	In this study , we investigated whether increased generation of FR during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase ( CCO ) , complex IV of the respiratory chain , in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
16337777	4	786	DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4 . 8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups .
16337777	5	936	We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA - encoded subunit of CCO ( CCO - I ) or a relative decrease in CCO - I when compared with nuclear - encoded subunits ( CCO - IV and SDH - fp ) .
16337777	6	1141	No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry .
16337777	7	1209	Although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies , our results do not suggest that the FRs , generated during the acute phase , determined important abnormalities in mtDNA , in expression of CCO - I , and in CCO activity .
1639466	0	0	Adverse effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on nephrosclerosis in rats with renovascular hypertension .
1639466	1	118	The effect of a 6 - week treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure , albuminuria , renal hemodynamics , and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two - kidney , one clip renovascular hypertension .
1639466	2	419	Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery , hypertensive rats ( 178 + / - 4 mm Hg ) were randomly assigned to three groups : untreated hypertensive controls ( n = 8 ) , enalapril - treated ( n = 8 ) , or nitrendipine - treated ( n = 10 ) .
1639466	3	643	Sham - operated rats served as normotensive controls ( 128 + / - 3 mm Hg , n = 8 ) .
1639466	4	720	After 6 weeks of treatment , renal hemodynamics ( glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow ) were measured in the anesthetized rats .
1639466	5	858	Renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis .
1639466	6	936	Enalapril but not nitrendipine reduced blood pressure significantly .
1639466	7	1005	After 6 weeks of therapy , glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups .
1639466	8	1102	Renal plasma flow increased , but albumin excretion and glomerulosclerosis did not change after enalapril treatment .
1639466	9	1218	In contrast , in the nitrendipine - treated group albuminuria increased from 12 . 8 + / - 2 progressively to 163 + / - 55 compared with 19 . 2 + / - 9 mg / 24 hr in the hypertensive controls .
1639466	10	1395	Furthermore , glomerulosclerosis index was significantly increased in the nitrendipine - treated group compared with the hypertensive controls ( 0 . 38 + / - 0 . 1 versus 0 . 13 + / - 0 . 04 ) .
1639466	11	1572	In addition , glomerular size was higher in the nitrendipine - treated group ( 14 . 9 + / - 0 . 17 10 ( - 3 ) mm2 ) but lower in the enalapril - treated group ( 11 . 5 + / - 0 . 15 10 ( - 3 ) mm2 ) compared with the hypertensive controls ( 12 . 1 + / - 0 . 17 10 ( - 3 ) mm2 ) . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
16403073	0	0	Ketoconazole induced torsades de pointes without concomitant use of QT interval - prolonging drug .
16403073	1	97	Ketoconazole is not known to be proarrhythmic without concomitant use of QT interval - prolonging drugs .
16403073	2	200	We report a woman with coronary artery disease who developed a markedly prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes ( TdP ) after taking ketoconazole for treatment of fungal infection .
16403073	3	385	Her QT interval returned to normal upon withdrawal of ketoconazole .
16403073	4	453	Genetic study did not find any mutation in her genes that encode cardiac IKr channel proteins .
16403073	5	548	We postulate that by virtue of its direct blocking action on IKr , ketoconazole alone may prolong QT interval and induce TdP .
16403073	6	673	This calls for attention when ketoconazole is administered to patients with risk factors for acquired long QT syndrome .
16428221	0	0	Cerebral vasculitis following oral methylphenidate intake in an adult : a case report .
16428221	1	86	Methylphenidate is structurally and functionally similar to amphetamine .
16428221	2	159	Cerebral vasculitis associated with amphetamine abuse is well documented , and in rare cases ischaemic stroke has been reported after methylphenidate intake in children .
16428221	3	328	We report the case of a 63 - year - old female who was treated with methylphenidate due to hyperactivity and suffered from multiple ischaemic strokes .
16428221	4	475	We consider drug - induced cerebral vasculitis as the most likely cause of recurrent ischaemic strokes in the absence of any pathological findings during the diagnostic work - up .
16428221	5	651	We conclude that methylphenidate mediated vasculitis should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of methylphenidate therapy .
16428221	6	806	This potential side - effect , though very rare , represents one more reason to be very restrictive in the use of methylphenidate .
16574712	0	0	MDMA polydrug users show process - specific central executive impairments coupled with impaired social and emotional judgement processes .
16574712	1	136	In recent years working memory deficits have been reported in users of MDMA ( 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , ecstasy ) .
16574712	2	258	The current study aimed to assess the impact of MDMA use on three separate central executive processes ( set shifting , inhibition and memory updating ) and also on " prefrontal " mediated social and emotional judgement processes .
16574712	3	484	Fifteen polydrug ecstasy users and 15 polydrug non - ecstasy user controls completed a general drug use questionnaire , the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task ( set shifting ) , Backward Digit Span procedure ( memory updating ) , Inhibition of Return ( inhibition ) , an emotional intelligence scale , the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire ( DEX ) .
16574712	4	851	Compared with MDMA - free polydrug controls , MDMA polydrug users showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating , and also in social and emotional judgement processes .
16574712	5	1024	The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use .
16574712	6	1107	These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational ecstasy use .
1664218	0	0	Phase II study of the amsacrine analogue CI - 921 ( NSC 343499 ) in non - small cell lung cancer .
1664218	1	92	CI - 921 ( NSC 343499 ; 9 - [ [ 2 - methoxy - 4 - [ ( methylsulphonyl ) amino ] phenyl ] amino ] - N , 5 - dimethyl - 4 - acridinecarboxamide ) is a topoisomerase II poison with high experimental antitumour activity .
1664218	2	277	It was administered by 15 min infusion to 16 evaluable patients with non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) ( 7 with no prior treatment , 9 patients in relapse following surgery / radiotherapy ) at a dose ( 648 mg / m2 divided over 3 days , repeated every 3 weeks ) determined by phase I trial .
1664218	3	558	Patients had a median performance status of 1 ( WHO ) , and median age of 61 years .
1664218	4	639	The histology comprised squamous carcinoma ( 11 ) , adenocarcinoma ( 1 ) , mixed histology ( 2 ) , bronchio - alveolar carcinoma ( 1 ) and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma ( 1 ) .
1664218	5	808	Neutropenia grade greater than or equal to 3 was seen in 15 patients , infections with recovery in 3 , and grand mal seizures in 1 patient .
1664218	6	946	Grade less than or equal to 2 nausea and vomiting occurred in 66 % courses and phlebitis in the infusion arm in 37 % . 1 patient with squamous cell carcinoma achieved a partial response lasting 5 months .
1664218	7	1147	Further testing in this and other tumour types using multiple daily schedules is warranted .
16680561	0	0	Pharmacokinetics of desipramine HCl when administered with cinacalcet HCl .
16680561	1	75	OBJECTIVE : In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme ( CYP ) 2D6 .
16680561	2	195	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity , using desipramine as a probe substrate , in healthy subjects .
16680561	3	343	METHODS : Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized , open - label , crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine ( 50 mg ) on two separate occasions , once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet ( 90 mg for 7 days ) .
16680561	4	640	Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose .
16680561	5	701	RESULTS : Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms .
16680561	6	759	Relative to desipramine alone , mean AUC and C ( max ) of desipramine increased 3 . 6 - and 1 . 8 - fold when coadministered with cinacalcet .
16680561	7	890	The t ( 1 / 2 , z ) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet ( 21 . 0 versus 43 . 3 hs ) .
16680561	8	1005	The t ( max ) was similar between the regimens .
16680561	9	1051	Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet ( 33 versus 86 % ) , the most frequent of which ( nausea and headache ) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet .
16680561	10	1326	CONCLUSION : This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 .
16680561	11	1411	These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet , dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6 .
16740173	0	0	Case report : acute unintentional carbachol intoxication .
16740173	1	57	INTRODUCTION : Intoxications with carbachol , a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare .
16740173	2	153	We report an interesting case investigating a ( near ) fatal poisoning .
16740173	3	223	METHODS : The son of an 84 - year - old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer ' s disease .
16740173	4	362	The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound ' carbamylcholin ' ; that is , carbachol .
16740173	5	479	He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy , and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg .
16740173	6	587	Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC - mass spectrometry .
16740173	7	709	RESULTS : Minutes after oral administration , the patient developed nausea , sweating and hypotension , and finally collapsed .
16740173	8	832	Bradycardia , cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred .
16740173	9	889	Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline ( epinephrine ) , atropine and furosemide was successful .
16740173	10	1022	On hospital admission , blood pressure of the intubated , bradyarrhythmic patient was 100 / 65 mmHg .
16740173	11	1119	Further signs were hyperhidrosis , hypersalivation , bronchorrhoea , and severe miosis ; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio - ventricular dissociation .
16740173	12	1273	High doses of atropine ( up to 50 mg per 24 hours ) , adrenaline and dopamine were necessary .
16740173	13	1364	The patient was extubated 1 week later .
16740173	14	1404	However , increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation .
16740173	15	1476	Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction .
16740173	16	1586	One week later , the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward .
16740173	17	1689	On the next day he died , probably as a result of heart failure .
16740173	18	1753	Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3 . 6 and 1 . 9 mg / l carbachol , respectively .
16740173	19	1850	The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg / l .
16740173	20	1919	CONCLUSION : This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper , initiated by published , peer - reviewed research on herbals , and involved human failure in a case history , medical examination and clinical treatment .
16740173	21	2142	For the first time , an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been developed .
16740173	22	2258	The analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260 .
16740173	23	2390	Especially in old patients , intensivists should consider intoxications ( with cholinergics ) as a cause of acute cardiovascular failure .
16755009	0	0	Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of cognitive dysfunctions .
16755009	1	105	The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions , total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice .
16755009	2	283	The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds ( DCE ) was administered orally in three doses ( 100 , 200 , 400 mg / kg ) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice .
16755009	3	465	Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory .
16755009	4	582	Diazepam - , scopolamine - and ageing - induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models .
16755009	5	680	DCE ( 200 , 400 mg / kg , p . o . ) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice .
16755009	6	779	The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23 % at the dose of 200 mg / kg and 35 % at the dose of 400 mg / kg in young mice using elevated plus maze .
16755009	7	932	Similarly , significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice .
16755009	8	1048	Furthermore , DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 0 . 4 mg / kg , i . p . ) and diazepam ( 1 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
16755009	9	1157	Daucus carota extract ( 200 , 400 mg / kg , p . o . ) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice .
16755009	10	1311	The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg / kg was 22 % in young and 19 % in aged mice .
16755009	11	1447	There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well , to the extent of 23 % in young and 21 % in aged animals with this dose of DCE .
16755009	12	1593	Therefore , DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as , memory improving property , cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity .
16787750	0	0	Valproic acid induced encephalopathy - - 19 new cases in Germany from 1994 to 2003 - - a side effect associated to VPA - therapy not only in young children .
16787750	1	149	Valproic acid ( VPA ) is a broad - spectrum antiepileptic drug and is usually well - tolerated .
16787750	2	239	Rare serious complications may occur in some patients , including haemorrhagic pancreatitis , bone marrow suppression , VPA - induced hepatotoxicity and VPA - induced encephalopathy .
16787750	3	415	The typical signs of VPA - induced encephalopathy are impaired consciousness , sometimes marked EEG background slowing , increased seizure frequency , with or without hyperammonemia .
16787750	4	593	There is still no proof of causative effect of VPA in patients with encephalopathy , but only of an association with an assumed causal relation .
16787750	5	737	We report 19 patients with VPA - associated encephalopathy in Germany from the years 1994 to 2003 , none of whom had been published previously .
16858720	0	0	Cerebral haemorrhage induced by warfarin - the influence of drug - drug interactions .
16858720	1	84	PURPOSE : To evaluate the frequency , severity and preventability of warfarin - induced cerebral haemorrhages due to warfarin and warfarin - drug interactions in patients living in the county of Osterg tland , Sweden .
16858720	2	296	METHODS : All patients with a diagnosed cerebral haemorrhage at three hospitals during the period 2000 - 2002 were identified .
16858720	3	420	Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether warfarin and warfarin - drug interactions could have caused the cerebral haemorrhage .
16858720	4	569	The proportion of possibly avoidable cases due to drug interactions was estimated .
16858720	5	652	RESULTS : Among 593 patients with cerebral haemorrhage , 59 ( 10 % ) were assessed as related to warfarin treatment .
16858720	6	764	This imply an incidence of 1 . 7 / 100 , 000 treatment years .
16858720	7	820	Of the 59 cases , 26 ( 44 % ) had a fatal outcome , compared to 136 ( 25 % ) among the non - warfarin patients ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
16858720	8	933	A warfarin - drug interaction could have contributed to the haemorrhage in 24 ( 41 % ) of the warfarin patients and in 7 of these ( 12 % ) the bleeding complication was considered being possible to avoid .
16858720	9	1130	CONCLUSIONS : Warfarin - induced cerebral haemorrhages are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate .
16858720	10	1238	Almost half of the cases was related to a warfarin - drug interaction .
16858720	11	1307	A significant proportion of warfarin - related cerebral haemorrhages might have been prevented if greater caution had been taken when prescribing drugs known to interact with warfarin .
16867021	0	0	Antipsychotic - like profile of thioperamide , a selective H3 - receptor antagonist in mice .
16867021	1	88	Experimental and clinical evidence points to a role of central histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia .
16867021	2	210	The present study was designed to study the effect of histamine H ( 3 ) - receptor ligands on neuroleptic - induced catalepsy , apomorphine - induced climbing behavior and amphetamine - induced locomotor activities in mice .
16867021	3	422	Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol ( 2 mg / kg p . o . ) , while apomorphine ( 1 . 5 mg / kg s . c . ) and amphetamine ( 2 mg / kg s . c . ) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities , respectively . ( R ) - alpha - methylhistamine ( RAMH ) ( 5 microg i . c . v . ) and thioperamide ( THP ) ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) , per se did not cause catalepsy .
16867021	4	745	Administration of THP ( 3 . 75 , 7 . 5 and 15 mg / kg i . p . ) 1 h prior to haloperidol resulted in a dose - dependent increase in the catalepsy times ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
16867021	5	895	However , pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed such an effect of THP ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) .
16867021	6	989	RAMH per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time , distance traveled and average speed but THP ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) per se had no effect on these parameters .
16867021	7	1151	On amphetamine - induced hyperactivity , THP ( 3 . 75 and 7 . 5 mg / kg i . p . ) reduced locomotor time , distance traveled and average speed ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
16867021	8	1291	Pretreatment with RAMH ( 5 microg i . c . v . ) could partially reverse such effects of THP ( 3 . 75 mg / kg i . p . ) .
16867021	9	1395	Climbing behavior induced by apomorphine was reduced in animals treated with THP .
16867021	10	1477	Such an effect was , however , reversed in presence of RAMH .
16867021	11	1536	THP exhibited an antipsychotic - like profile by potentiating haloperidol - induced catalepsy , reducing amphetamine - induced hyperactivity and reducing apomorphine - induced climbing in mice .
16867021	12	1721	Such effects of THP were reversed by RAMH indicating the involvement of histamine H ( 3 ) - receptors .
16867021	13	1819	Findings suggest a potential for H ( 3 ) - receptor antagonists in improving the refractory cases of schizophrenia .
16904497	0	0	Cauda equina syndrome after epidural steroid injection : a case report .
16904497	1	71	OBJECTIVE : Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral radiculopathy are physical therapy , epidural steroid injections , oral medications , and spinal manipulative therapy .
16904497	2	244	Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia .
16904497	3	313	The following case is a report of cauda equina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine .
16904497	4	441	CLINICAL FEATURES : A 50 - year - old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection .
16904497	5	559	INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME : An 18 - gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L4 - 5 level .
16904497	6	676	Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging .
16904497	7	772	After verifying the epidural space , bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injected .
16904497	8	863	After the injection , there was a reduction in radicular symptoms .
16904497	9	929	Three hours later , she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity weakness .
16904497	10	1014	The neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg .
16904497	11	1122	There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test .
16904497	12	1179	Deep - tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg .
16904497	13	1244	She was unable to urinate .
16904497	14	1271	The patient ' s symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours .
16904497	15	1337	She had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling Foley catheter .
16904497	16	1419	All of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours .
16904497	17	1487	CONCLUSION : Complications associated with epidural steroid injections are rare .
16904497	18	1567	Clinical examination and continued vigilance for neurologic deterioration after epidural steroid injections is important .
16938416	0	0	High - dose testosterone is associated with atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women .
16938416	1	83	OBJECTIVES : To study the long - term effects of androgen treatment on atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women .
16938416	2	192	METHODS : In a population - based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54 - 67 years , we studied the association between self - reported intramuscularly administered high - dose estrogen - testosterone therapy ( estradiol - and testosterone esters ) and aortic atherosclerosis .
16938416	3	468	Aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta , which have been shown to reflect intima atherosclerosis .
16938416	4	634	Hormone therapy users were compared with never users .
16938416	5	688	RESULTS : Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women .
16938416	6	778	In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present ( n = 11 ) , while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20 % ( OR 3 . 1 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 8 . 5 , adjusted for age , years since menopause , smoking , and body mass index ) .
16938416	7	1062	The association remained after additional adjustment for diabetes , cholesterol level , systolic blood pressure , or alcohol use .
16938416	8	1189	No association was found for hormone use less than 1 year .
16938416	9	1248	CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that high - dose testosterone therapy may adversely affect atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women and indicate that androgen replacement in these women may not be harmless .
17020434	0	0	Optimising stroke prevention in non - valvular atrial fibrillation .
17020434	1	66	Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality .
17020434	2	142	Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62 % , and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22 % .
17020434	3	322	Overall , in high - risk patients , warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes , with a relative risk reduction of 36 % .
17020434	4	448	Ximelagatran , an oral direct thrombin inhibitor , was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events , but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests .
17020434	5	667	The ACTIVE - W ( Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events ) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy ( clopidogrel plus aspirin ) in the prevention af embolic events .
17020434	6	903	Idraparinux , a Factor Xa inhibitor , is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation .
17020434	7	996	Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor - blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling .
17020434	8	1145	Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion .
17020434	9	1262	Finally , percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high - risk patients .
17042910	0	0	Anti - oxidant effects of atorvastatin in dexamethasone - induced hypertension in the rat . 1 .
17042910	1	90	Dexamethasone ( Dex ) - induced hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with nitric oxide ( NO ) deficiency and increased superoxide ( O2 - ) production .
17042910	2	263	Atorvastatin ( Ato ) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of NO and reduced O2 - production in various forms of hypertension .
17042910	3	469	In the present study , we investigated whether 50 mg / kg per day , p . o . , Ato could prevent endothelial NO synthase ( eNOS ) downregulation and the increase in O2 - in Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rats , thereby reducing blood pressure . 2 .
17042910	4	692	Male SD rats ( n = 30 ) were treated with Ato ( 50 mg / kg per day in drinking water ) or tap water for 15 days .
17042910	5	799	Dexamethasone ( 10 microg / kg per day , s . c . ) or saline was started after 4 days in Ato - treated and non - treated rats and continued for 11 - 13 days .
17042910	6	943	Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) was measured on alternate days using the tail - cuff method .
17042910	7	1032	Endothelial function was assessed by acetylcholine - induced vasorelaxation and phenylephrine - induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments .
17042910	8	1169	Vascular eNOS mRNA was assessed by semi - quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction . 3 .
17042910	9	1274	In rats treated with Dex alone , SBP was increased from 109 + / - 2 to 133 + / - 2 mmHg on Days 4 and Day 14 , respectively ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
17042910	10	1405	In the Ato + Dex group , SBP was increased from 113 + / - 2 to 119 + / - 2 mmHg on Days 4 to 14 , respectively ( P < 0 . 001 ) , but was significantly lower than SBP in the group treated with Dex alone ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
17042910	11	1608	Endothelial - dependent relaxation and eNOS mRNA expression were greater in the Dex + Ato group than in the Dex only group ( P < 0 . 05 and P < 0 . 0001 , respectively ) .
17042910	12	1770	Aortic superoxide production was lower in the Dex + Ato group compared with the group treated with Dex alone ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . 4 .
17042910	13	1896	Treatment with Ato improved endothelial function , reduced superoxide production and reduced SBP in Dex - treated SD rats .
17111419	0	0	Severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation .
17111419	1	76	We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection .
17111419	2	174	The donor was a 40 - year - old female , first - time apheresis platelet donor .
17111419	3	247	Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and depression .
17111419	4	333	Reported medications included bumetanide , pravastatin , and paroxetine .
17111419	5	404	Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure , the donor noted tingling around the mouth , hands , and feet .
17111419	6	512	She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany .
17111419	7	595	Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated , and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes .
17111419	8	742	The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia .
17111419	9	892	Upon additional retrospective analysis , it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia .
17111419	10	1021	We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity .
17111419	11	1200	Laboratory measurement of pre - procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance .
17111419	12	1331	The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors .
17147461	0	0	Sirolimus - associated proteinuria and renal dysfunction .
17147461	1	56	Sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor - containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase .
17147461	2	232	Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy .
17147461	3	369	Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis , autoimmunity , cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation .
17147461	4	493	Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors , it has been designated a ' non - nephrotoxic drug ' .
17147461	5	648	However , clinical reports suggest that , under some circumstances , sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction .
17147461	6	784	A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre - existing chronic renal damage .
17147461	7	866	The mechanisms of sirolimus - associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal .
17147461	8	1043	It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury , but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive .
17147461	9	1202	The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus ( such as in delayed graft function ) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair processes .
17147461	10	1390	Although these adverse effects occur in some patients , their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney , the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations , close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function , use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed .
17147461	11	1788	Further long - term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future .
17175308	0	0	Proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus in renal transplant recipients .
17175308	1	74	Sirolimus ( SRL ) is a new , potent immunosuppressive agent .
17175308	2	132	More recently , proteinuria has been reported as a consequence of sirolimus therapy , although the mechanism has remained unclear .
17175308	3	261	We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients , who developed or displayed increased proteinuria after SRL conversion .
17175308	4	405	The patient cohort ( 14 men , 11 women ) was treated with SRL as conversion therapy , due to chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) ( n = 15 ) neoplasia ( n = 8 ) ; Kaposi ' s sarcoma , Four skin cancers , One intestinal tumors , One renal cell carsinom ) or BK virus nephropathy ( n = 2 ) .
17175308	5	676	SRL was started at a mean of 78 + / - 42 ( 15 to 163 ) months after transplantation .
17175308	6	757	Mean follow - up on SRL therapy was 20 + / - 12 ( 6 to 43 ) months .
17175308	7	819	Proteinuria increased from 0 . 445 ( 0 to 1 . 5 ) g / d before conversion to 3 . 2 g / dL ( 0 . 2 to 12 ) after conversion ( P = 0 . 001 ) .
17175308	8	939	Before conversion 8 ( 32 % ) patients had no proteinuria , whereas afterwards all patients had proteinuria .
17175308	9	1043	In 28 % of patients proteinuria remained unchanged , whereas it increased in 68 % of patients .
17175308	10	1135	In 40 % it increased by more than 100 % .
17175308	11	1174	Twenty - eight percent of patients showed increased proteinuria to the nephrotic range .
17175308	12	1260	Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes : One membranoproliferative glomerulopathy and interstitial nephritis .
17175308	13	1400	These patients showed persistently good graft function .
17175308	14	1456	Serum creatinine values did not change significantly : 1 . 98 + / - 0 . 8 mg / dL before SRL therapy and 2 . 53 + / - 1 . 9 mg / dL at last follow - up ( P = . 14 ) .
17175308	15	1600	Five grafts were lost and the patients returned to dialysis .
17175308	16	1661	Five patients displayed CAN and Kaposi ' s sarcoma .
17175308	17	1711	Mean urinary protein of patients who returned to dialysis was 1 . 26 ( 0 . 5 to 3 . 5 ) g / d before and 4 . 7 ( 3 to 12 ) g / d after conversion ( P = . 01 ) .
17175308	18	1852	Mean serum creatinine level before conversion was 2 . 21 mg / dL and thereafter , 4 . 93 mg / dL ( P = . 02 ) .
17175308	19	1951	Heavy proteinuria was common after the use of SRL as rescue therapy for renal transplantation .
17175308	20	2046	Therefore , conversion should be considered for patients who have not developed advanced CAN and proteinuria .
17175308	21	2155	The possibility of de novo glomerular pathology under SRL treatment requires further investigation by renal biopsy .
1720453	0	0	Long - term follow - up of ifosfamide renal toxicity in children treated for malignant mesenchymal tumors : an International Society of Pediatric Oncology report .
1720453	1	158	The renal function of 74 children with malignant mesenchymal tumors in complete remission and who have received the same ifosfamide chemotherapy protocol ( International Society of Pediatric Oncology Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor Study 84 [ SIOP MMT 84 ] ) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment .
1720453	2	464	Total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g / m2 of ifosfamide ( six or 10 cycles of ifosfamide , vincristine , and dactinomycin [ IVA ] ) .
1720453	3	591	None of them had received cisplatin chemotherapy .
1720453	4	641	Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years ; 58 patients were males and 42 females .
1720453	5	719	The most common primary tumor site was the head and neck .
1720453	6	777	Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes , glucosuria , proteinuria , aminoaciduria , urinary pH , osmolarity , creatinine clearance , phosphate tubular reabsorption , beta 2 microglobulinuria , and lysozymuria .
1720453	7	1016	Fifty - eight patients ( 78 % ) had normal renal tests , whereas 16 patients ( 22 % ) had renal abnormalities .
1720453	8	1118	Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group : the first included four patients ( 5 % of the total population ) who developed major toxicity resulting in Fanconi ' s syndrome ( TDFS ) ; and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low phosphate reabsorption .
1720453	9	1428	The remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria .
1720453	10	1496	Severe toxicity was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g / m2 of ifosfamide , a younger age ( less than 2 1 / 2 years old ) , and a predominance of vesicoprostatic tumor involvement .
1720453	11	1685	This low percentage ( 5 % ) of TDFS must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of ifosfamide in the treatment of mesenchymal tumors in children .
17241784	0	0	Progressive myopathy with up - regulation of MHC - I associated with statin therapy .
17241784	1	81	Statins can cause a necrotizing myopathy and hyperCKaemia which is reversible on cessation of the drug .
17241784	2	185	What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy , which persists or may progress after stopping the drug .
17241784	3	320	We investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cases .
17241784	4	374	All had myofibre necrosis but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate .
17241784	5	443	In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up - regulation of MHC - I expression even in non - necrotic fibres .
17241784	6	551	Progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of prednisolone and methotrexate , and in one case spontaneously .
17241784	7	679	These observations suggest that statins may initiate an immune - mediated myopathy that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy .
17241784	8	846	The mechanism of this myopathy is uncertain but may involve the induction by statins of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up - regulation of MHC - I expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres .
17242861	0	0	Use of chromosome substitution strains to identify seizure susceptibility loci in mice .
17242861	1	88	Seizure susceptibility varies among inbred mouse strains .
17242861	2	146	Chromosome substitution strains ( CSS ) , in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain ( donor ) has been transferred onto a second strain ( host ) by repeated backcrossing , may be used to identify quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) that contribute to seizure susceptibility .
17242861	3	418	QTLs for susceptibility to pilocarpine - induced seizures , a model of temporal lobe epilepsy , have not been reported , and CSS have not previously been used to localize seizure susceptibility genes .
17242861	4	614	We report QTLs identified using a B6 ( host ) x A / J ( donor ) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine - induced seizures .
17242861	5	760	Three hundred fifty - five adult male CSS mice , 58 B6 , and 39 A / J were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine - induced seizures .
17242861	6	888	Highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice .
17242861	7	964	B6 mice were resistant to seizures and slower to reach stages compared to A / J mice .
17242861	8	1048	The CSS for Chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages , diverging dramatically from the B6 phenotype .
17242861	9	1166	Latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for CSS10 and CSS18 mice .
17242861	10	1244	CSS mapping suggests seizure susceptibility loci on mouse Chromosomes 10 and 18 .
17242861	11	1325	This approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy .
17244258	0	0	In vitro characterization of parasympathetic and sympathetic responses in cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in the rat .
17244258	1	120	In cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in the rat , detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered .
17244258	2	263	Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated .
17244258	3	360	Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide - pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic , adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists .
17244258	4	603	Generally , atropine reduced contractions , but in contrast to controls , it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity ( 1 - 5 Hz ) in inflamed preparations .
17244258	5	781	In both types , purinoceptor desensitization with alpha , beta - methylene adenosine - 5 ' - triphosphate ( alpha , beta - meATP ) caused further reductions at low frequencies ( < 10 Hz ) .
17244258	6	951	The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine , 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine ( 4 - DAMP ) ( ' M ( 1 ) / M ( 3 ) / M ( 5 ) - selective ' ) , methoctramine ( ' M ( 2 ) - selective ' ) and pirenzepine ( ' M ( 1 ) - selective ' ) antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component . 4 - DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine .
17244258	7	1380	In inflamed preparations , the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4 - DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls .
17244258	8	1641	In contrast to controls , methoctramine increased - - instead of decreased - - the tonic responses at high frequencies .
17244258	9	1758	While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response , isoprenaline - induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips .
17244258	10	1960	Thus , in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur .
17244258	11	2042	While postjunctional beta - adrenoceptor - mediated relaxations are reduced , effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased .
17261653	0	0	Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - gated pacemaker channels by clonidine .
17261653	1	114	BACKGROUND : Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease , including arrhythmia , coronary heart disease , and chronic heart failure .
17261653	2	312	Activation of presynaptic alpha2 - adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine ; however , other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine .
17261653	3	549	METHODS AND RESULTS : To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2 - adrenoceptors , we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2 - adrenoceptor subtypes ( alpha2ABC - / - ) .
17261653	4	767	Alpha2ABC - / - mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine ; however , clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC - / - mice by up to 150 bpm .
17261653	5	957	Clonidine - induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC - / - mice was 32 . 3 % ( 10 microg / kg ) and 26 . 6 % ( 100 microg / kg ) of the effect in wild - type mice .
17261653	6	1102	A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC - knockout and wild - type mice .
17261653	7	1247	Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current ( I ( f ) ) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I ( f ) - generating hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - gated ( HCN ) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells .
17261653	8	1478	As a consequence of blocking I ( f ) , clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild - type and alpha2ABC - knockout mice .
17261653	9	1684	CONCLUSIONS : Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene - targeted mice in vivo , and thus , clonidine - like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors .
1728522	0	0	Granulomatous hepatitis due to combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid .
1728522	1	79	We report the case of a patient with amoxicillin - clavulanic acid - induced hepatitis with histologic multiple granulomas .
1728522	2	199	This type of lesion broadens the spectrum of liver injury due to this drug combination , mainly represented by a benign cholestatic syndrome .
1728522	3	340	The association of granulomas and eosinophilia favor an immunoallergic mechanism .
1728522	4	422	As penicillin derivatives and amoxicillin alone are known to induce such types of lesions , the amoxicillin component , with or without a potentiating effect of clavulanic acid , might have a major role .
1732369	0	0	Dobutamine stress echocardiography : a sensitive indicator of diminished myocardial function in asymptomatic doxorubicin - treated long - term survivors of childhood cancer .
1732369	1	169	Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic cardiomyopathy .
1732369	2	280	To develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for cardiac damage due to doxorubicin , a cohort study was performed using dobutamine infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long - term survivors of childhood cancer treated with doxorubicin from healthy control subjects .
1732369	3	561	Echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients ( mean age 16 + / - 5 years ) treated from 1 . 6 to 14 . 3 years ( median 5 . 3 ) before this study with 27 to 532 mg / m2 of doxorubicin ( mean 196 ) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age - matched control subjects .
1732369	4	849	Graded dobutamine infusions of 0 . 5 , 2 . 5 , 5 and 10 micrograms / kg per min were administered .
1732369	5	940	Echocardiographic Doppler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rate .
1732369	6	1048	Dobutamine infusion at 10 micrograms / kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50 % incidence rate of adverse symptoms .
1732369	7	1186	The most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects , end - systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in doxorubicin - treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with dobutamine stimulation .
1732369	8	1521	End - systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the doxorubicin - treated group was 11 + / - 1 . 9 mm versus 13 . 1 + / - 1 . 5 mm for control subjects ( p less than 0 . 01 ) .
1732369	9	1704	End - systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at the 5 - micrograms / kg per min dobutamine infusion for the doxorubicin - treated group was 14 . 1 + / - 2 . 4 mm versus 19 . 3 + / - 2 . 6 mm for control subjects ( p less than 0 . 01 ) . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
17343925	0	0	Influence of smoking on developing cochlea .
17343925	1	44	Does smoking during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns ?
17343925	2	151	OBJECTIVE : Maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth .
17343925	3	225	The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated , although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults .
17343925	4	394	The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions ( TEOAEs ) of healthy neonates .
17343925	5	543	METHODS : This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns .
17343925	6	671	Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy ( n = 200 ears ) were compared to a control group of newborns ( n = 200 ears ) , whose mothers were non - smokers .
17343925	7	832	Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low ( < 5 cigarettes per day , n = 88 ears ) , moderate ( 5 < or = cigarettes per day < 10 , n = 76 ) or high ( > or = 10 cigarettes per day , n = 36 ) .
17343925	8	1004	RESULTS : In exposed neonates , TEOAEs mean response ( across frequency ) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non - exposed neonates .
17343925	9	1157	Comparisons between exposed newborns ' subgroups revealed no significant differences .
17343925	10	1242	However , by comparing each subgroup to control group , we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups .
17343925	11	1394	Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group .
17343925	12	1509	CONCLUSION : In utero , exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells .
17343925	13	1609	These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns , regardless of the degree of exposure .
17343925	14	1711	Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate ' s hearing acuity .
17344566	0	0	Simvastatin - induced bilateral leg compartment syndrome and myonecrosis associated with hypothyroidism .
17344566	1	103	A 54 - year - old hypothyroid male taking thyroxine and simvastatin presented with bilateral leg compartment syndrome and myonecrosis .
17344566	2	234	Urgent fasciotomies were performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery with the withdrawal of simvastatin .
17344566	3	349	It is likely that this complication will be seen more often with the increased worldwide use of this drug and its approval for all arteriopathic patients .
17400887	0	0	Neuroinflammation and behavioral abnormalities after neonatal terbutaline treatment in rats : implications for autism .
17400887	1	118	Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting before 3 years of age with deficits in communication and social skills and repetitive behaviors .
17400887	2	266	In addition to genetic influences , recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for autism .
17400887	3	394	Terbutaline , a beta2 - adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor , has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins .
17400887	4	544	We studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats .
17400887	5	678	Newborn rats were given terbutaline ( 10 mg / kg ) daily on postnatal days ( PN ) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30 .
17400887	6	828	Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex , as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter .
17400887	7	1055	None of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on PN 11 to 14 .
17400887	8	1131	In behavioral tests , animals treated with terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper - reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field , as well as in the acoustic startle response test .
17400887	9	1364	Our findings indicate that beta2 - adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and behavioral abnormalities , similar to those described in autism .
17400887	10	1609	This study provides a useful animal model for understanding the neuropathological processes underlying autism spectrum disorders .
17437408	0	0	Upregulation of brain expression of P - glycoprotein in MRP2 - deficient TR ( - ) rats resembles seizure - induced up - regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats .
17437408	1	168	PURPOSE : The multidrug resistance protein 2 ( MRP2 ) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) .
17437408	2	448	MRP2 is absent in the transport - deficient ( TR ( - ) ) Wistar rat mutant , so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2 - deficient rats with those in transport - competent Wistar rats .
17437408	3	732	By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB .
17437408	4	907	However , one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur .
17437408	5	1064	This prompted us to study the brain expression of P - glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues , including the BBB , in TR ( - ) rats compared with nonmutant ( wild - type ) Wistar rats .
17437408	6	1267	METHODS : The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR ( - ) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry , by using a novel , highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219 , respectively .
17437408	7	1526	RESULTS : Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats , whereas such labeling was absent in TR ( - ) rats .
17437408	8	1727	TR ( - ) rats exhibited a significant up - regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild - type controls .
17437408	9	1854	No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections .
17437408	10	1922	A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine - induced seizures in wild - type Wistar rats .
17437408	11	2042	Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR ( - ) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB .
17437408	12	2261	CONCLUSIONS : The data on TR ( - ) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB .
17437408	13	2390	Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds , the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB .
17437408	14	2594	Furthermore , our data suggest that TR ( - ) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain , without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp - enhancing events for this purpose .
17439425	0	0	Role of xanthine oxidase in dexamethasone - induced hypertension in rats . 1 .
17439425	1	75	Glucocorticoid - induced hypertension ( GC - HT ) in the rat is associated with nitric oxide - redox imbalance . 2 .
17439425	2	182	We studied the role of xanthine oxidase ( XO ) , which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species , in dexamethasone - induced hypertension ( dex - HT ) . 3 .
17439425	3	345	Thirty male Sprague - Dawley rats were divided randomly into four treatment groups : saline , dexamethasone ( dex ) , allopurinol plus saline , and allopurinol plus dex . 4 .
17439425	4	510	Systolic blood pressures ( SBP ) and bodyweights were recorded each alternate day .
17439425	5	591	Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity , and serum urate to assess XO inhibition . 5 .
17439425	6	698	Dex increased SBP ( 110 + / - 2 - 126 + / - 3 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ) and decreased thymus ( P < 0 . 001 ) and bodyweights ( P " < 0 . 01 ) .
17439425	7	816	Allopurinol decreased serum urate from 76 + / - 5 to 30 + / - 3 micromol / L ( P < 0 . 001 ) in saline and from 84 + / - 13 to 28 + / - 2 micromol / L in dex - treated ( P < 0 . 01 ) groups . 6 .
17439425	8	988	Allopurinol did not prevent dex - HT .
17439425	9	1024	This , together with our previous findings that allopurinol failed to prevent adrenocorticotrophic hormone induced hypertension , suggests that XO activity is not a major determinant of GC - HT in the rat .
17466854	0	0	Side effects of postoperative administration of methylprednisolone and gentamicin into the posterior sub - Tenon ' s space .
17466854	1	120	PURPOSE : To assess the incidence of postoperative emetic side effects after the administration of methylprednisolone and gentamicin into the posterior sub - Tenon ' s space at the end of routine cataract surgery .
17466854	2	329	SETTING : St . Luke ' s Hospital , Gwardamangia , Malta .
17466854	3	380	METHODS : A double - blind double - armed prospective study comprised 40 patients who had uneventful sutureless phacoemulsification under sub - Tenon ' s local infiltration of 3 mL of plain lignocaine .
17466854	4	573	At the end of the procedure , Group A ( n = 20 ) had 20 mg / 0 . 5 mL of methylprednisolone and 10 mg / 0 . 5 mL of gentamicin injected into the posterior sub - Tenon ' s space and Group B ( n = 20 ) had the same combination injected into the anterior sub - Tenon ' s space .
17466854	5	827	Postoperatively , all patients were assessed for symptoms of nausea , vomiting , and headache .
17466854	6	919	A chi - square test was used to assess the statistical significance of results .
17466854	7	997	RESULTS : Sixty percent in Group A developed postoperative emetic symptoms , headache , or both ; 1 patient in Group B developed symptoms .
17466854	8	1132	CONCLUSIONS : The administration of methylprednisolone and gentamicin in the posterior sub - Tenon ' s space was related to a high incidence of side effects including nausea , vomiting , and headache .
17466854	9	1326	All adverse effects were self - limiting .
17491223	0	0	Assessment of a new non - invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia .
17491223	1	119	BACKGROUND : Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia .
17491223	2	231	OBJECTIVES : To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index ( dP / dtejc ) measurement , based on brachial artery flow changes , as compared to standard 12 - lead ECG , for detecting dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia , using Tc99m - Sestamibi single - photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia .
17491223	3	616	METHODS : The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi - SPECT / dobutamine stress test .
17491223	4	714	Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP / dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level .
17491223	5	817	In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT .
17491223	6	909	The increase in dP / dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non - ischemic group .
17491223	7	1039	dP / dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results , giving an ECG - enhanced value , and compared to ECG alone .
17491223	8	1148	RESULTS : The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16 % to 79 % , positive predictive value increased from 60 % to 68 % and negative predictive value from 54 % to 78 % , and specificity decreased from 90 % to 67 % .
17491223	9	1354	CONCLUSIONS : If ECG alone is used for specificity , the combination with dP / dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost - savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia , especially in patients unable to exercise .
1749407	0	0	Cocaine - induced myocardial infarction : clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations .
1749407	1	94	Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute myocardial infarction .
1749407	2	239	In individuals with preexisting , high - grade coronary arterial narrowing , acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine - induced increase in rate - pressure product .
1749407	3	463	In other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction , coronary occlusion may be due to spasm , thrombus , or both .
1749407	4	591	With regard to spasm , the clinical findings are largely circumstantial , and the locus of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction remains speculative .
1749407	5	734	Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial , medium - size vessels , other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction .
1749407	6	914	Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental , discrete infarction .
1749407	7	1016	Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha - mediated , other in vitro data suggest the opposite .
1749407	8	1134	The finding of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction in segments of ( noninnervated ) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha - mediated effects .
1749407	9	1398	Finally , the contribution of a primary , thrombotic effect of cocaine has not been excluded .
17532790	0	0	Proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of L - DOPA - induced dyskinesia .
17532790	1	87	L - DOPA - induced dyskinesia ( LID ) is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) patients after a prolonged treatment with L - DOPA .
17532790	2	241	To this day , transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of LID [ Neurobiol .
17532790	3	330	Dis . , 17 ( 2004 ) , 219 ] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking .
17532790	4	409	In the present study , we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6 - hydroxydopamine - lesion rat model of PD treated with saline , L - DOPA or bromocriptine using two - dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry ( MS ) .
17532790	5	708	Rats treated with L - DOPA were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of LID .
17532790	6	803	Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference , 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight MS , atmospheric pressure matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS ( LC / MS / MS ) .
17532790	7	1098	Out of these 67 proteins , LID significantly changed the expression level of five proteins : alphabeta - crystalin , gamma - enolase , guanidoacetate methyltransferase , vinculin , and proteasome alpha - 2 subunit .
17532790	8	1301	Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach .
17532790	9	1476	In conclusion , this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in LID .
17562951	0	0	Cardiac Angiography in Renally Impaired Patients ( CARE ) study : a randomized double - blind trial of contrast - induced nephropathy in patients with chronic kidney disease .
17562951	1	168	BACKGROUND : No direct comparisons exist of the renal tolerability of the low - osmolality contrast medium iopamidol with that of the iso - osmolality contrast medium iodixanol in high - risk patients .
17562951	2	363	METHODS AND RESULTS : The present study is a multicenter , randomized , double - blind comparison of iopamidol and iodixanol in patients with chronic kidney disease ( estimated glomerular filtration rate , 20 to 59 mL / min ) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions .
17562951	3	653	Serum creatinine ( SCr ) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications .
17562951	4	795	The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0 . 5 mg / dL ( 44 . 2 micromol / L ) over baseline .
17562951	5	893	Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25 % , a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25 % , and the mean peak change in SCr .
17562951	6	1058	In 414 patients , contrast volume , presence of diabetes mellitus , use of N - acetylcysteine , mean baseline SCr , and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups .
17562951	7	1241	SCr increases > or = 0 . 5 mg / dL occurred in 4 . 4 % ( 9 of 204 patients ) after iopamidol and 6 . 7 % ( 14 of 210 patients ) after iodixanol ( P = 0 . 39 ) , whereas rates of SCr increases > or = 25 % were 9 . 8 % and 12 . 4 % , respectively ( P = 0 . 44 ) .
17562951	8	1467	In patients with diabetes , SCr increases > or = 0 . 5 mg / dL were 5 . 1 % ( 4 of 78 patients ) with iopamidol and 13 . 0 % ( 12 of 92 patients ) with iodixanol ( P = 0 . 11 ) , whereas SCr increases > or = 25 % were 10 . 3 % and 15 . 2 % , respectively ( P = 0 . 37 ) .
17562951	9	1702	Mean post - SCr increases were significantly less with iopamidol ( all patients : 0 . 07 versus 0 . 12 mg / dL , 6 . 2 versus 10 . 6 micromol / L , P = 0 . 03 ; patients with diabetes : 0 . 07 versus 0 . 16 mg / dL , 6 . 2 versus 14 . 1 micromol / L , P = 0 . 01 ) .
17562951	10	1925	CONCLUSIONS : The rate of contrast - induced nephropathy , defined by multiple end points , is not statistically different after the intraarterial administration of iopamidol or iodixanol to high - risk patients , with or without diabetes mellitus .
17562951	11	2166	Any true difference between the agents is small and not likely to be clinically significant .
17600377	0	0	A novel compound , maltolyl p - coumarate , attenuates cognitive deficits and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo dementia models .
17600377	1	142	To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection , we newly synthesized maltolyl p - coumarate by the esterification of maltol and p - coumaric acid .
17600377	2	334	In the present study , we investigated whether maltolyl p - coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine - injected rats and in amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) - infused rats .
17600377	3	510	Maltolyl p - coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) - infused rats .
17600377	4	732	We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p - coumarate in vitro using SH - SY5Y cells .
17600377	5	831	Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p - coumarate , before exposed to amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) , glutamate or H2O2 .
17600377	6	945	We found that maltolyl p - coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species , cytochrome c release , and caspase 3 activation .
17600377	7	1110	Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together , our study suggests that maltolyl p - coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer ' s disease that is characterized by wide spread neuronal death and progressive decline of cognitive function .
17608141	0	0	Attenuation of methamphetamine - induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice by lipopolysaccharide pretreatment .
17608141	1	124	Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine - induced dopaminergic terminal damage .
17608141	2	239	In this study , we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide , a pro - inflammatory and inflammatory factor , treatment in modulating the methamphetamine - induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity .
17608141	3	433	Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine - elicited hyperthermia three days later .
17608141	4	566	Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine - induced striatal dopamine and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose - dependent manner .
17608141	5	735	As the most potent dose ( 1 mg / kg ) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks , one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen , methamphetamine - induced striatal dopamine and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered .
17608141	6	987	Moreover , systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment ( 1 mg / kg ) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion - produced dopamine and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum , indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine .
17608141	7	1323	We concluded a critical time window for systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment in exerting effective protection against methamphetamine - induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity .
17612891	0	0	Acute myocarditis associated with clozapine .
17612891	1	45	OBJECTIVE : A case of acute myocarditis associated with the commencement of clozapine is described , highlighting the onset , course and possible contributing factors .
17612891	2	210	There is an urgent need to raise awareness about this potentially fatal complication of clozapine use .
17612891	3	313	RESULTS : A 20 - year - old male with schizophrenia developed a sudden onset of myocarditis after commencement of clozapine .
17612891	4	433	The patient recovered with intensive medical support .
17612891	5	487	The symptoms occurred around 2 weeks after starting clozapine in an inpatient setting .
17612891	6	574	Possible contributing factors may have been concomitant antidepressant use and unaccustomed physical activity .
17612891	7	685	CONCLUSIONS : Myocarditis is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of clozapine .
17612891	8	791	It can be fatal if not recognized and treated early .
17612891	9	844	Considering that clozapine remains the gold standard in treatment of resistant psychosis , there is an urgent need to raise awareness among medical and paramedical staff involved in the care of these patients .
17612891	10	1053	There are also implications for recommendations and regulations regarding the use of clozapine .
17615423	0	0	Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure secondary to concomitant use of simvastatin , amiodarone , and atazanavir .
17615423	1	119	OBJECTIVE : To report a case of a severe interaction between simvastatin , amiodarone , and atazanavir resulting in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure .
17615423	2	272	BACKGROUND : A 72 - year - old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus , atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain , fatigue , and dark orange urine for 3 days .
17615423	3	495	The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime ( initiated 27 days earlier ) ; amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days , then 200 mg daily ( initiated 19 days earlier ) ; and 400 mg atazanavir daily ( initiated at least 2 years previously ) .
17615423	4	741	Laboratory evaluation revealed 66 , 680 U / L creatine kinase , 93 mg / dL blood urea nitrogen , 4 . 6 mg / dL creatinine , 1579 U / L aspartate aminotransferase , and 738 U / L alanine aminotransferase .
17615423	5	927	Simvastatin , amiodarone , and the patient ' s human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis .
17615423	6	1121	Nine days later the patient ' s creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U / L and creatinine was 3 . 3 mg / dL .
17615423	7	1221	The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered .
17615423	8	1330	DISCUSSION : The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism .
17615423	9	1456	Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4 .
17615423	10	1494	Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors .
17615423	11	1554	CONCLUSIONS : Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions .
17615423	12	1692	In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors , pravastatin , fluvastatin , and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions ; atorvastatin carries moderate risk , whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors .
17639754	0	0	Interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin : case series .
17639754	1	60	Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant and is indicated for many clinical conditions .
17639754	2	159	Levofloxacin , a fluoroquinolone , is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in clinical practice and is effective against Gram - positive , Gram - negative , and atypical bacteria .
17639754	3	342	While small prospective studies have not revealed any significant drug - drug interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin , several case reports have indicated that levofloxacin may significantly potentiate the anticoagulation effect of warfarin .
17639754	4	588	We report 3 cases of serious bleeding complications that appear to be the result of the interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin .
17639754	5	723	Physicians should be aware of this potential interaction and use caution when prescribing levofloxacin to patients taking warfarin .
17854040	0	0	Mutations associated with lamivudine - resistance in therapy - na ve hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infected patients with and without HIV co - infection : implications for antiretroviral therapy in HBV and HIV co - infected South African patients .
17854040	1	234	This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine - resistant hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) strains in selected lamivudine - na ve HBV carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) co - infection in South African patients .
17854040	2	467	Thirty - five lamivudine - na ve HBV infected patients with or without HIV co - infection were studied : 15 chronic HBV mono - infected patients and 20 HBV - HIV co - infected patients .
17854040	3	641	The latter group was further sub - divided into 13 occult HBV ( HBsAg - negative ) and 7 overt HBV ( HBsAg - positive ) patients .
17854040	4	762	HBsAg , anti - HBs , anti - HBc , and anti - HIV 1 / 2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays ( Abbott Laboratories , North Chicago , IL ) .
17854040	5	912	Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase ( RT ) primers , followed by direct sequencing across the tyrosine - methionine - aspartate - aspartate ( YMDD ) motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme .
17854040	6	1152	HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v2 . 0 ( Roche Diagnostics , Penzberg , Germany ) .
17854040	7	1257	HBV lamivudine - resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono - infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 HBV - HIV co - infected patients .
17854040	8	1401	To the best of our knowledge , this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine - resistant strains in therapy - na ve HBV - HIV co - infected patients .
17854040	9	1549	The HBV viral loads for mono - infected and co - infected patients ranged from 3 . 32 x 10 ( 2 ) to 3 . 82 x 10 ( 7 ) and < 200 to 4 . 40 x 10 ( 3 ) copies / ml , respectively .
17854040	10	1703	It remains to be seen whether such pre - existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine - containing highly active antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment ( HAART ) regimens become widely applied in South Africa , as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBV - HIV co - infected patients .
1786266	0	0	Rabbit syndrome , antidepressant use , and cerebral perfusion SPECT scan findings .
1786266	1	81	The rabbit syndrome is an extrapyramidal side effect associated with chronic neuroleptic therapy .
1786266	2	179	Its occurrence in a patient being treated with imipramine is described , representing the first reported case of this syndrome in conjunction with antidepressants .
1786266	3	342	Repeated cerebral perfusion SPECT scans revealed decreased basal ganglia perfusion while the movement disorder was present , and a return to normal perfusion when the rabbit syndrome resolved .
17879945	0	0	Estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir .
17879945	1	113	Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir .
17879945	2	235	Many patients , however , develop negative long - term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis .
17879945	3	334	We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice .
17879945	4	488	Furthermore , peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir - treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation .
17879945	5	609	In the present study , we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir .
17879945	6	803	We have utilized the human monocyte cell line , THP - 1 as a model to address this question .
17879945	7	893	Briefly , cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage - like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta - estradiol ( E2 ) , 100 nM progesterone or vehicle ( 0 . 01 % ethanol ) .
17879945	8	1097	Cells were then treated with 30 ng / ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h . Cell extracts were harvested , and lipid or total RNA was isolated .
17879945	9	1267	E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment .
17879945	10	1365	Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor , CD36 mRNA , responsible for the uptake of LDL .
17879945	11	1473	Additionally , ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA , a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression .
17879945	12	1647	Treatment with E2 , however , failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level .
17879945	13	1728	E2 did , however , significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry .
17879945	14	1836	This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte - derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment .
17919553	0	0	Acute hepatitis attack after exposure to telithromycin .
17919553	1	56	INTRODUCTION : Antibiotic - associated hepatotoxicity is rare .
17919553	2	116	With widespread use of antimicrobial agents , however , hepatic injury occurs frequently , and among adverse drug reactions , idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious .
17919553	3	284	CASE SUMMARY : A 25 - year - old male patient , with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department , Istanbul , Turkey , with 5 days ' history of jaundice , malaise , nausea , and vomiting .
17919553	4	516	He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg / d PO to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior .
17919553	5	625	Admission laboratory tests were as follows : alanine aminotransferase , 67 U / L ( reference range , 10 - 37 U / L ) ; aspartate aminotransferase , 98 U / L ( 10 - 40 U / L ) ; alkaline phosphatase , 513 U / L ( 0 - 270 U / L ) ; gamma - glutamyltransferase , 32 U / L ( 7 - 49 U / L ) ; amylase , 46 U / L ( 0 - 220 U / L ) ; total bilirubin , 20 . 1 mg / dL ( 0 . 2 - 1 . 0 mg / dL ) ; direct bilirubin , 14 . 8 mg / dL ( 0 - 0 . 3 mg / dL ) ; and albumin , 4 . 7 mg / dL ( 3 . 5 - 5 . 4 mg / dL ) .
17919553	6	1027	No toxin , alcohol , or other drugs were reported .
17919553	7	1076	The patient had suffered a previous episode of " acute hepatitis of unknown origin , " that occurred after telithromycin usage .
17919553	8	1201	Both incidents occurred within a year .
17919553	9	1240	DISCUSSION : Telithromycin is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use .
17919553	10	1380	It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction .
17919553	11	1470	Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale , telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient , and pathological findings suggested drug - induced toxic hepatitis .
17919553	12	1687	Recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time .
17919553	13	1861	CONCLUSION : Here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin .
17931375	0	0	A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on bruising and pain .
17931375	1	94	AIM : This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin .
17931375	2	264	BACKGROUND : Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described , the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented .
17931375	3	514	DESIGN : This study was designed as within - subject , quasi - experimental research .
17931375	4	594	METHOD : The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered .
17931375	5	699	Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site .
17931375	6	807	Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection .
17931375	7	908	Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper .
17931375	8	1025	The visual analog scale ( VAS ) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop - watch was used to time the pain period .
17931375	9	1141	Data were analysed using chi - square test , Mann - Whitney U , Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation .
17931375	10	1244	RESULTS : The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64 % with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42 % in the 30 - second injection .
17931375	11	1377	It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30 - second injection .
17931375	12	1465	Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30 - second injection than for the 10 - second injection .
17931375	13	1597	CONCLUSIONS : It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin .
17931375	14	1741	This study should be repeated on a larger sample .
17931375	15	1791	RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE : When administering subcutaneous heparin injections , it is important to extend the duration of the injection .
18004067	0	0	Acute liver failure in two patients with regular alcohol consumption ingesting paracetamol at therapeutic dosage .
18004067	1	114	BACKGROUND : The possible role of alcohol in the development of hepatotoxicity associated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) is currently debated .
18004067	2	279	CASE REPORT : We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of alcohol and who developed liver failure within 3 - 5 days after hospitalization and stopping alcohol consumption while being treated with 4 g paracetamol / day .
18004067	3	502	A paracetamol serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range .
18004067	4	590	Possible risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol are discussed .
18004067	5	723	CONCLUSION : In patients with risk factors , e . g . regular consumption of alcohol , liver failure is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested .
18004067	6	866	We propose that the paracetamol dose should not exceed 2 g / day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with paracetamol .
18020536	0	0	Associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health , physical abilities and cognitive function : a non - randomised clinical study in the elderly .
18020536	1	164	OBJECTIVE : To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs ( BZDs / RDs ) and health , functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly .
18020536	2	335	METHODS : A non - randomised clinical study of patients aged > or = 65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month . 164 patients ( mean age + / - standard deviation [ SD ] 81 . 6 + / - 6 . 8 years ) were admitted .
18020536	3	543	Of these , nearly half ( n = 78 ) had used BZDs / RDs before admission , and the remainder ( n = 86 ) were non - users .
18020536	4	653	Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) .
18020536	5	729	Patients scoring > or = 20 MMSE sum points were interviewed ( n = 79 ) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission .
18020536	6	892	Data on use of BZDs / RDs before admission , current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records .
18020536	7	1015	Health , physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD / RD users and non - users , and adjustments were made for confounding variables .
18020536	8	1168	The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam , temazepam and zopiclone were analysed .
18020536	9	1254	RESULTS : The mean + / - SD duration of BZD / RD use was 7 + / - 7 years ( range 1 - 31 ) .
18020536	10	1334	Two or three BZDs / RDs were concomitantly taken by 26 % of users ( n = 20 ) .
18020536	11	1407	Long - term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS , which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia .
18020536	12	1578	After adjustment for these variables as confounders , use of BZDs / RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE .
18020536	13	1715	However , use of BZDs / RDs was associated with dizziness , inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay .
18020536	14	1964	Use of BZDs / RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night - time sleep during the week prior to admission .
18020536	15	2100	A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables .
18020536	16	2234	CONCLUSIONS : Long - term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD / RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses .
18020536	17	2378	Long - term use was associated with daytime and night - time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs .
18023325	0	0	Acute vocal fold palsy after acute disulfiram intoxication .
18023325	1	60	Acute peripheral neuropathy caused by a disulfiram overdose is very rare and there is no report of it leading to vocal fold palsy .
18023325	2	191	A 49 - year - old woman was transferred to our department because of quadriparesis , lancinating pain , sensory loss , and paresthesia of the distal limbs .
18023325	3	340	One month previously , she had taken a single high dose of disulfiram ( 130 tablets of ALCOHOL STOP TAB , Shin - Poong Pharm .
18023325	4	461	Co . , Ansan , Korea ) in a suicide attempt .
18023325	5	502	She was not an alcoholic .
18023325	6	528	For the first few days after ingestion , she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate ataxia and giddiness .
18023325	7	643	She noticed hoarseness and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state .
18023325	8	762	A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy .
18023325	9	850	Laryngeal electromyography ( thyroarytenoid muscle ) showed ample denervation potentials .
18023325	10	938	Laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation .
18023325	11	1010	Her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer .
18023325	12	1101	This was a case of acute palsy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and superimposed severe acute sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy caused by high - dose disulfiram intoxication .
18081909	0	0	Encephalopathy induced by levetiracetam added to valproate .
18081909	1	60	BACKGROUND : We report on the manifestation of a levetiracetam ( LEV ) - induced encephalopathy .
18081909	2	152	FINDINGS : A 28 - year - old man suffering from idiopathic epilepsy with generalized seizures was treated with LEV ( 3000 mg ) added to valproate ( VPA ) ( 2000 mg ) .
18081909	3	308	Frequency of generalized tonic - clonic seizures increased from one per 6 months to two per month .
18081909	4	405	Neuropsychological testing showed impaired word fluency , psychomotor speed and working memory .
18081909	5	500	The interictal electroencephalogram ( EEG ) showed a generalized slowing to 5 per second theta rhythms with bilateral generalized high - amplitude discharges .
18081909	6	655	OUTCOME : Following discontinuation of LEV , EEG and neuropsychological findings improved and seizure frequency decreased .
18083142	0	0	Norepinephrine signaling through beta - adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of cocaine - induced anxiety .
18083142	1	114	BACKGROUND : Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties .
18083142	2	218	While the mechanisms underlying cocaine ' s rewarding effects have been studied extensively , less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine , such as anxiety .
18083142	3	411	METHODS : In this study , we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta - hydroxylase knockout ( Dbh - / - ) mice , which lack norepinephrine ( NE ) , in the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine - induced anxiety .
18083142	4	665	RESULTS : We found that cocaine dose - dependently increased anxiety - like behavior in control ( Dbh + / - ) mice , as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration .
18083142	5	823	The Dbh - / - mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine .
18083142	6	951	Cocaine - induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh + / - mice following administration of disulfiram , a dopamine beta - hydroxylase ( DBH ) inhibitor .
18083142	7	1096	In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists , we found that pretreatment with the beta - adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine - induced anxiety - like behavior in Dbh + / - and wild - type C57BL6 / J mice , while the alpha ( 1 ) antagonist prazosin and the alpha ( 2 ) antagonist yohimbine had no effect .
18083142	8	1412	CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta - adrenergic receptors is required for cocaine - induced anxiety in mice .
18162529	0	0	Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels , prolactin signaling , and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol .
18162529	1	193	Hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido .
18162529	2	245	Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this , the mechanisms are poorly understood .
18162529	3	353	We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility : pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen - induced LH surge .
18162529	4	534	Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40 % reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats , but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol .
18162529	5	733	Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid - induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge .
18162529	6	864	Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( PRL - R ) and components of prolactin ' s signaling pathway .
18162529	7	1004	To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL - R expression and sensitivity to prolactin , we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin - induced STAT5 activation .
18162529	8	1187	Lastly , we measured PRL - R and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS - 1 and - 3 and CIS , which reflect the level of prolactin signaling ) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol .
18162529	9	1368	Sulpiride induced only SOCS - 1 in the medial preoptic area , where GnRH neurons are regulated , but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus , PRL - R , SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels were also induced .
18162529	10	1562	Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS - 3 and CIS .
18162529	11	1614	Interestingly , estradiol also induced PRL - R , SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels independently .
18162529	12	1702	These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid - dependent manner .
18162529	13	1818	They also provide evidence for estradiol - dependent and brain region - specific regulation of PRL - R expression and signaling responses by prolactin .
18182964	0	0	Clonidine for attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder : II .
18182964	1	60	ECG changes and adverse events analysis .
18182964	2	101	OBJECTIVE : To examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or with methylphenidate in children with attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
18182964	3	265	METHOD : In a 16 - week multicenter , double - blind trial , 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to clonidine ( n = 31 ) , methylphenidate ( n = 29 ) , clonidine and methylphenidate ( n = 32 ) , or placebo ( n = 30 ) .
18182964	4	475	Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0 . 6 mg / day for clonidine and 60 mg / day for methylphenidate ( both with divided dosing ) .
18182964	5	597	Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs .
18182964	6	719	RESULTS : There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine ( 17 . 5 % versus 3 . 4 % ; p = . 02 ) , but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes .
18182964	7	986	There were no suggestions of interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes .
18182964	8	1101	Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on clonidine ( 79 . 4 % versus 49 . 2 % ; p = . 0006 ) but not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal .
18182964	9	1272	Drowsiness was common on clonidine , but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks .
18182964	10	1348	CONCLUSIONS : Clonidine , used alone or with methylphenidate , appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD .
18182964	11	1459	Physicians prescribing clonidine should monitor for bradycardia and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial drowsiness .
18186898	0	0	Renal Fanconi syndrome and myopathy after liver transplantation : drug - related mitochondrial cytopathy ?
18186898	1	103	Advances in the field of transplantation provide a better quality of life and allow more favorable conditions for growth and development in children .
18186898	2	253	However , combinations of different therapeutic regimens require consideration of potential adverse reactions .
18186898	3	363	We describe a 15 - yr - old girl who had orthotopic liver transplantation because of Wilson ' s disease .
18186898	4	462	Tacrolimus , MMF , and steroids were given as immunosuppressant .
18186898	5	525	Lamivudine was added because of de nova hepatitis B infection during her follow - up .
18186898	6	609	Three yr after transplantation she developed renal Fanconi syndrome with severe metabolic acidosis , hypophosphatemia , glycosuria , and aminoaciduria .
18186898	7	758	Although tacrolimus was suspected to be the cause of late post - transplant renal acidosis and was replaced by sirolimus , acidosis , and electrolyte imbalance got worse .
18186898	8	925	Proximal muscle weakness has developed during her follow - up .
18186898	9	986	Fanconi syndrome , as well as myopathy , is well recognized in patients with mitochondrial disorders and caused by depletion of mtDNA .
18186898	10	1119	We suggest that our patient ' s tubular dysfunction and myopathy may have resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction which is triggered by tacrolimus and augmented by lamivudine .
18208574	0	0	Higher optical density of an antigen assay predicts thrombosis in patients with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .
18208574	1	114	OBJECTIVES : To correlate optical density and percent inhibition of a two - step heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) antigen assay with thrombosis ; the assay utilizes reaction inhibition characteristics of a high heparin concentration .
18208574	2	350	PATIENTS AND METHODS : Patients with more than 50 % decrease in platelet count or thrombocytopenia ( < 150 x 10 ( 9 ) / L ) after exposure to heparin , who had a positive two - step antigen assay [ optical density ( OD ) > 0 . 4 and > 50 inhibition with high concentration of heparin ] were included in the study .
18208574	3	643	RESULTS : Forty of 94 HIT patients had thrombosis at diagnosis ; 54 / 94 had isolated - HIT without thrombosis .
18208574	4	749	Eight of the isolated - HIT patients developed thrombosis within the next 30 d ; thus , a total of 48 patients had thrombosis at day 30 .
18208574	5	882	At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between HIT patients with thrombosis and those with isolated - HIT .
18208574	6	1003	However , OD was significantly higher in all patients with thrombosis ( n = 48 , 1 . 34 + / - 0 . 89 ) , including isolated - HIT patients who later developed thrombosis within 30 d ( n = 8 , 1 . 84 + / - 0 . 64 ) as compared to isolated - HIT patients who did not develop thrombosis ( 0 . 96 + / - 0 . 75 ; P = 0 . 011 and P = 0 . 008 ) .
18208574	7	1305	The Receiver Operative Characteristic Curve showed that OD > 1 . 27 in the isolated - HIT group had a significantly higher chance of developing thrombosis by day 30 .
18208574	8	1466	None of these groups showed significant difference in percent inhibition .
18208574	9	1540	Multivariate analysis showed a 2 . 8 - fold increased risk of thrombosis in females .
18208574	10	1621	Similarly , thrombotic risk increased with age and OD values .
18208574	11	1682	CONCLUSION : Higher OD is associated with significant risk of subsequent thrombosis in patients with isolated - HIT ; percent inhibition , however , was not predictive .
18217897	0	0	Thalidomide has limited single - agent activity in relapsed or refractory indolent non - Hodgkin lymphomas : a phase II trial of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B .
18217897	1	157	Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated activity in multiple myeloma , mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma .
18217897	2	299	Its activity is believed to be due modulation of the tumour milieu , including downregulation of angiogenesis and inflammatory cytokines .
18217897	3	436	Between July 2001 and April 2004 , 24 patients with relapsed / refractory indolent lymphomas received thalidomide 200 mg daily with escalation by 100 mg daily every 1 - 2 weeks as tolerated , up to a maximum of 800 mg daily .
18217897	4	655	Patients had received a median of 2 ( range , 1 - 4 ) prior regimens .
18217897	5	720	Of 24 evaluable patients , two achieved a complete remission and one achieved a partial remission for an overall response rate of 12 . 5 % ( 95 % confidence interval : 2 . 6 - 32 . 4 % ) .
18217897	6	893	Eleven patients progressed during therapy .
18217897	7	936	Grade 3 - 4 adverse effects included myelosuppression , fatigue , somnolence / depressed mood , neuropathy and dyspnea .
18217897	8	1049	Of concern was the occurrence of four thromboembolic events .
18217897	9	1110	Our results failed to demonstrate an important response rate to single agent thalidomide in indolent lymphomas and contrast with the higher activity level reported with the second generation immunomodulatory agent , lenalidomide .
18221780	0	0	Sex differences in NMDA antagonist enhancement of morphine antihyperalgesia in a capsaicin model of persistent pain : comparisons to two models of acute pain .
18221780	1	158	In acute pain models , N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of morphine to a greater extent in males than females .
18221780	2	311	The purpose of this investigation was to extend these findings to a persistent pain model which could be distinguished from acute pain models on the basis of the nociceptive fibers activated , neurochemical substrates , and duration of the nociceptive stimulus .
18221780	3	571	To this end , persistent hyperalgesia was induced by administration of capsaicin in the tail of gonadally intact F344 rats , following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus , and tail - withdrawal latencies measured .
18221780	4	810	For comparison , tests were conducted in two acute pain models , the hotplate and warm water tail - withdrawal procedures .
18221780	5	929	In males , the non - competitive NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan enhanced the antihyperalgesic effect of low to moderate doses of morphine in a dose - and time - dependent manner .
18221780	6	1103	Across the doses and pretreatment times examined , enhancement was not observed in females .
18221780	7	1194	Enhancement of morphine antinociception by dextromethorphan was seen in both males and females in the acute pain models , with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males .
18221780	8	1373	These findings demonstrate a sexually - dimorphic interaction between NMDA antagonists and morphine in a persistent pain model that can be distinguished from those observed in acute pain models .
18261172	0	0	Development of proteinuria after switch to sirolimus - based immunosuppression in long - term cardiac transplant patients .
18261172	1	119	Calcineurin - inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients .
18261172	2	214	The novel immunosuppressive ( IS ) drug sirolmus ( Srl ) lacks nephrotoxic effects ; however , proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation .
18261172	3	386	In cardiac transplantation , the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown .
18261172	4	475	In this study , long - term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl - based IS .
18261172	5	577	Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil + / - steroids .
18261172	6	641	Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0 . 13 g / day ( range 0 - 5 . 7 ) preswitch to 0 . 23 g / day ( 0 - 9 . 88 ) at 24 months postswitch ( p = 0 . 0024 ) .
18261172	7	790	Before the switch , 11 . 5 % of patients had high - grade proteinuria ( > 1 . 0 g / day ) ; this increased to 22 . 9 % postswitch ( p = 0 . 006 ) .
18261172	8	916	ACE inhibitor and angiotensin - releasing blocker ( ARB ) therapy reduced proteinuria development .
18261172	9	1011	Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function ( median 42 . 5 vs . 64 . 1 , p = 0 . 25 ) , whereas patients who developed high - grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow - up ( median 39 . 6 vs . 29 . 2 , p = 0 . 125 ) .
18261172	10	1248	Thus , proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl , which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients .
18261172	11	1400	Srl should be used with ACEi / ARB therapy and patients monitored for proteinuria and increased renal dysfunction .
18308784	0	0	Ginsenoside Rg1 restores the impairment of learning induced by chronic morphine administration in rats .
18308784	1	104	Rg1 , as a ginsenoside extracted from Panax ginseng , could ameliorate spatial learning impairment .
18308784	2	202	Previous studies have demonstrated that Rg1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morphine .
18308784	3	339	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect .
18308784	4	503	Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine ( 10 mg / kg ) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days , and Rg1 ( 30 mg / kg ) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days .
18308784	5	734	Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze .
18308784	6	799	The results showed that rats treated with Morphine / Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency .
18308784	7	953	By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo , the results showed that Rg1 restored the long - term potentiation ( LTP ) impaired by morphine in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats .
18308784	8	1164	The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine , but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline - or morphine / Rg1 - treated rats ; this restoration could be inhibited by N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist MK801 .
18308784	9	1466	We conclude that Rg1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic morphine administration and restore the morphine - inhibited LTP .
18308784	10	1626	This effect is NMDA receptor dependent .
18329269	0	0	Synthesis of N - pyrimidinyl - 2 - phenoxyacetamides as adenosine A2A receptor antagonists .
18329269	1	86	A series of N - pyrimidinyl - 2 - phenoxyacetamide adenosine A ( 2A ) antagonists is described .
18329269	2	173	SAR studies led to compound 14 with excellent potency ( K ( i ) = 0 . 4 nM ) , selectivity ( A ( 1 ) / A ( 2A ) > 100 ) , and efficacy ( MED 10 mg / kg p . o . ) in the rat haloperidol - induced catalepsy model for Parkinson ' s disease .
1833784	0	0	Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced hyperactivity in rats .
1833784	1	113	Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation .
1833784	2	287	In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined .
1833784	3	422	In addition , the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine .
1833784	4	646	Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague - Dawley rats tested in photocell cages .
1833784	5	733	Nicotine ( 1 . 0 mg / kg ) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment , but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment .
1833784	6	965	The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium , indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors .
1833784	7	1200	Nicotine - induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390 , the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1 / D2 antagonist fluphenazine .
1833784	8	1363	Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine - induced hyperactivity , whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 had no effect .
1833784	9	1490	The results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment .
1833784	10	1620	The effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors , possibly located on dopaminergic neurons , and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors .
18343374	0	0	Central retinal vein occlusion associated with clomiphene - induced ovulation .
18343374	1	77	OBJECTIVE : To report a case of central retinal vein occlusion associated with clomiphene citrate ( CC ) .
18343374	2	180	DESIGN : Case study .
18343374	3	200	SETTING : Ophthalmology clinic of an academic hospital .
18343374	4	255	PATIENT ( S ) : A 36 - year - old woman referred from the infertility clinic for blurred vision .
18343374	5	344	INTERVENTION ( S ) : Ophthalmic examination after CC therapy .
18343374	6	402	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE ( S ) : Central retinal vein occlusion after ovulation induction with CC .
18343374	7	493	RESULT ( S ) : A 36 - year - old Chinese woman developed central retinal vein occlusion after eight courses of CC .
18343374	8	600	A search of the literature on the thromboembolic complications of CC does not include this severe ophthalmic complication , although mild visual disturbance after CC intake is not uncommon .
18343374	9	789	CONCLUSION ( S ) : This is the first reported case of central retinal vein occlusion after treatment with CC .
18343374	10	895	Extra caution is warranted in treating infertility patients with CC , and patients should be well informed of this side effect before commencement of therapy .
1835291	0	0	Acute bronchodilating effects of ipratropium bromide and theophylline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
1835291	1	112	The bronchodilator effects of a single dose of ipratropium bromide aerosol ( 36 micrograms ) and short - acting theophylline tablets ( dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10 - 20 micrograms / mL ) were compared in a double - blind , placebo - controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
1835291	2	439	Mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15 % increase in the FEV1 ( responders ) were 31 % and 90 % , respectively , for ipratropium and 17 % and 50 % , respectively , for theophylline .
1835291	3	704	The average FEV1 increases during the 6 - hour observation period were 18 % for ipratropium and 8 % for theophylline .
1835291	4	818	The mean duration of action was 3 . 8 hours with ipratropium and 2 . 4 hours with theophylline .
1835291	5	910	While side effects were rare , those experienced after theophylline use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems .
1835291	6	1042	These results show that ipratropium is a more potent bronchodilator than oral theophylline in patients with chronic airflow obstruction .
18410508	0	0	Methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling .
18410508	1	116	Methamphetamine ( METH ) damages dopamine ( DA ) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated .
18410508	2	318	Cardona et al . [ Nat .
18410508	3	339	Neurosci . 9 ( 2006 ) , 917 ] recently identified the microglial - specific fractalkine receptor ( CX3CR1 ) as an important mediator of MPTP - induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons .
18410508	4	512	Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity , we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation .
18410508	5	742	Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity .
18410508	6	929	METH depleted DA , caused microglial activation , and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild - type controls .
18410508	7	1109	The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender - dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum .
18410508	8	1219	Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation .
18410508	9	1346	This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP - microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH .
18410508	10	1504	We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation .
18410508	11	1620	Furthermore , it appears that striatal - resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration .
18417364	0	0	Nicotine - induced nystagmus correlates with midpontine activation .
18417364	1	66	The pathomechanism of nicotine - induced nystagmus ( NIN ) is unknown .
18417364	2	133	The aim of this study was to delineate brain structures that are involved in NIN generation .
18417364	3	226	Eight healthy volunteers inhaled nicotine in darkness during a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) experiment ; eye movements were registered using video - oculography .
18417364	4	401	NIN correlated with blood oxygen level - dependent ( BOLD ) activity levels in a midpontine site in the posterior basis pontis .
18417364	5	525	NIN - induced midpontine activation may correspond to activation of the dorsomedial pontine nuclei and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis , structures known to participate in the generation of multidirectional saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements .
18439803	0	0	Acute effects of N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine - induced seizure in rats .
18439803	1	127	The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters ( glutamate , aspartate , glycine and GABA ) of N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea ( VPU ) in comparison to its parent compound , valproic acid ( VPA ) .
18439803	2	409	VPU was more potent than VPA , exhibiting the median effective dose ( ED ( 50 ) ) of 49 mg / kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine - induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg / kg .
18439803	3	607	In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA .
18439803	4	843	Pretreatment with either VPU ( 50 and 100 mg / kg ) or VPA ( 300 and 600 mg / kg ) completely abolished pilocarpine - evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate .
18439803	5	1010	In addition , a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level .
18439803	6	1180	Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine - induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate .
18439803	7	1447	Therefore , like VPA , the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine - induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account , at least partly , for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine - induced seizure in experimental animals .
18439803	8	1701	Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated .
18442015	0	0	Protective effect of verapamil on gastric hemorrhagic ulcers in severe atherosclerotic rats .
18442015	1	93	Studies concerning with pathogenesis of gastric hemorrhage and mucosal ulceration produced in atherosclerotic rats are lacking .
18442015	2	221	The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back - diffusion , mast cell histamine release , lipid peroxide ( LPO ) generation and mucosal microvascular permeability in modulating gastric hemorrhage and ulcer in rats with atherosclerosis induced by coadministration of vitamin D2 and cholesterol .
18442015	3	529	Additionally , the protective effect of verapamil on this ulcer model was evaluated .
18442015	4	613	Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1 . 0 ml / kg of corn oil containing vitamin D2 and cholesterol to induce atherosclerosis .
18442015	5	777	Control rats received corn oil only .
18442015	6	814	After gastric surgery , rat stomachs were irrigated for 3 h with either simulated gastric juice or normal saline .
18442015	7	927	Gastric acid back - diffusion , mucosal LPO generation , histamine concentration , microvascular permeability , luminal hemoglobin content and ulcer areas were determined .
18442015	8	1093	Elevated atherosclerotic parameters , such as serum calcium , total cholesterol and low - density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in atherosclerotic rats .
18442015	9	1252	Severe gastric ulcers accompanied with increased ulcerogenic factors , including gastric acid back - diffusion , histamine release , LPO generation and luminal hemoglobin content were also observed in these rats .
18442015	10	1460	Moreover , a positive correlation of histamine to gastric hemorrhage and to ulcer was found in those atherosclerotic rats .
18442015	11	1582	This hemorrhagic ulcer and various ulcerogenic parameters were dose - dependently ameliorated by daily intragastric verapamil .
18442015	12	1707	Atherosclerosis could produce gastric hemorrhagic ulcer via aggravation of gastric acid back - diffusion , LPO generation , histamine release and microvascular permeability that could be ameliorated by verapamil in rats .
18464113	0	0	Lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis B virus reactivation in hepatitis - B surface antigen ( HBSAG ) seropositive cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy .
18464113	1	167	Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease worldwide .
18464113	2	254	Cancer patients who are chronic carriers of HBV have a higher hepatic complication rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy ( CT ) and this has mainly been attributed to HBV reactivation .
18464113	3	443	In this study , cancer patients who have solid and hematological malignancies with chronic HBV infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior and during CT compared with historical control group who did not receive lamivudine .
18464113	4	678	The objectives were to assess the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation , and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT .
18464113	5	833	Two groups were compared in this study .
18464113	6	873	The prophylactic lamivudin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treatment .
18464113	7	979	The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic lamivudine .
18464113	8	1090	They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT .
18464113	9	1145	The outcomes were compared for both groups .
18464113	10	1189	Of our control group ( n = 50 ) , 21 patients ( 42 % ) were established hepatitis .
18464113	11	1265	Twelve ( 24 % ) of them were evaluated as severe hepatitis .
18464113	12	1322	In the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient ( 2 . 7 % ) of 37 patients ( p < 0 . 006 ) .
18464113	13	1443	Comparison of the mean ALT values revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) values in the control group than the prophylactic lamivudine group ; 154 : 64 ( p < 0 . 32 ) .
18464113	14	1630	Our study suggests that prophylactic lamivudine significantly decreases the incidence of HBV reactivation and overall morbidity in cancer patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy .
18464113	15	1821	Further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate nucleoside or nucleotide analogue for antiviral prophylaxis during CT and the optimal duration of administration after completion of CT .
18503483	0	0	Recovery of tacrolimus - associated brachial neuritis after conversion to everolimus in a pediatric renal transplant recipient - - case report and review of the literature .
18503483	1	168	TAC has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for solid organ transplantation in pediatrics .
18503483	2	273	Neurotoxicity is a potentially serious toxic effect .
18503483	3	326	It is characterized by encephalopathy , headaches , seizures , or neurological deficits .
18503483	4	412	Here , we describe an eight - and - a - half - yr - old male renal transplant recipient with right BN .
18503483	5	504	MRI demonstrated hyperintense T2 signals in the cervical cord and right brachial plexus roots indicative of both myelitis and right brachial plexitis .
18503483	6	655	Symptoms persisted for three months despite TAC dose reduction , administration of IVIG and four doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy .
18503483	7	794	Improvement and eventually full recovery only occurred after TAC was completely discontinued and successfully replaced by everolimus .
18544179	0	0	Omitting fentanyl reduces nausea and vomiting , without increasing pain , after sevoflurane for day surgery .
18544179	1	107	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane , postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently .
18544179	2	267	Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this , although it may also improve analgesia .
18544179	3	375	METHODS : This double - blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients .
18544179	4	573	Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl , while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl .
18544179	5	721	RESULTS : Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting , but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and / or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20 % and 17 % with fentanyl and fentanyl - dexamethasone , respectively , to 5 % ( P = 0 . 013 ) .
18544179	6	1011	Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24 % and 31 % to 7 % ( P = 0 . 0012 ) .
18544179	7	1085	Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting .
18544179	8	1192	Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids , reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35 % and 33 % to 22 % and 19 % ( P = 0 . 049 and P = 0 . 035 ) , respectively , while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42 % to 27 % ( P = 0 . 034 ) .
18544179	9	1515	Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl .
18544179	10	1601	Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane - sparing effect and increased respiratory depression , hypotension and bradycardia .
18544179	11	1756	CONCLUSION : As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects , it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery .
18560792	0	0	Valvular heart disease in patients with Parkinson ' s disease treated with pergolide .
18560792	1	84	Course following treatment modifications .
18560792	2	126	Valvular heart abnormalities have been reported in patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) treated with pergolide .
18560792	3	240	However , the incidence and severity of these abnormalities vary from study to study and their course after drug withdrawal has not been systematically assessed .
18560792	4	401	OBJECTIVES : To estimate the frequency and severity of valvular heart abnormality and its possible reversibility after drug withdrawal in a case - control study .
18560792	5	560	METHODS : All PD patients in the Amiens area treated with pergolide were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography .
18560792	6	717	Thirty PD patients participated in the study .
18560792	7	763	A second echocardiography was performed ( median interval : 13 months ) after pergolide withdrawal ( n = 10 patients ) .
18560792	8	876	Controls were age - and sex - matched non - PD patients referred to the cardiology department .
18560792	9	966	RESULTS : Compared to controls , aortic regurgitation ( OR : 3 . 1 ; 95 % IC : 1 . 1 - 8 . 8 ) and mitral regurgitation ( OR : 10 . 7 ; 95 % IC : 2 . 1 - 53 ) were more frequent in PD patients ( tricuspid : NS ) .
18560792	10	1148	The number of affected valves ( n = 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 7 ) and the sum of regurgitation grades ( n = 2 . 8 + / - 1 . 09 ) were higher ( p = 0 . 008 and p = 0 . 006 , respectively ) in the pergolide group .
18560792	11	1315	Severity of regurgitation was not correlated with pergolide cumulative dose .
18560792	12	1392	A restrictive pattern of valvular regurgitation , suggestive of the role of pergolide , was observed in 12 / 30 ( 40 % ) patients including two with heart failure .
18560792	13	1549	Pergolide was discontinued in 10 patients with valvular heart disease , resulting in a lower regurgitation grade ( p = 0 . 01 ) at the second transthoracic echocardiography and the two patients with heart failure returned to nearly normal clinical examination .
18560792	14	1803	This study supports the high frequency of restrictive valve regurgitation in PD patients treated with pergolide and reveals that a significant improvement is usual when the treatment is converted to non - ergot dopamine agonists .
18619688	0	0	Adriamycin - induced autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays a pathogenic role in a rat model of heart failure .
18619688	1	107	BACKGROUND : The mechanisms underlying heart failure induced by adriamycin are very complicated and still unclear .
18619688	2	221	The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin , so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart failure .
18619688	3	421	METHODS : 3 - methyladenine ( 3MA ) , a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin .
18619688	4	552	Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague - Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls , an adriamycin - treated group , and a 3MA plus adriamycin - treated group .
18619688	5	727	We then examined the morphology , expression of beclin 1 gene , mitochondrial permeability transition ( MPT ) , and Na + - K + ATPase activity in vivo .
18619688	6	870	We also assessed cell viability , mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes .
18619688	7	1004	In addition , we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene , beclin 1 using RT - PCR and Western blotting in an animal model .
18619688	8	1137	RESULTS : 3MA significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury .
18619688	9	1224	Furthermore , adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles , and 3MA strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin - induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles .
18619688	10	1440	CONCLUSION : Autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in rats induced by adriamycin .
18619688	11	1575	Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of heart failure caused by adriamycin via the autophagy pathway .
18631865	0	0	mToR inhibitors - induced proteinuria : mechanisms , significance , and management .
18631865	1	79	Massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of rapamycin ( mToR ) inhibitors , especially sirolimus , in renal transplant recipients with chronic allograft nephropathy .
18631865	2	317	Because proteinuria is a major predictive factor of poor transplantation outcome , many studies focused on this adverse event during the past years .
18631865	3	465	Whether proteinuria was due to sirolimus or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range proteinuria has been observed during sirolimus therapy in islet transplantation and in patients who received sirolimus de novo .
18631865	4	728	Podocyte injury and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have been related to mToR inhibition in some patients , but the pathways underlying these lesions remain hypothetic .
18631865	5	899	We discuss herein the possible mechanisms and the significance of mToR blockade - induced proteinuria .
1867351	0	0	Neuropsychiatric side effects after the use of mefloquine .
1867351	1	59	This study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with mefloquine .
1867351	2	155	Reactions consisted mainly of seizures , acute psychoses , anxiety neurosis , and major disturbances of sleep - wake rhythm .
1867351	3	275	Side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to severe .
1867351	4	385	In a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in Germany , it is estimated that one of 8 , 000 mefloquine users suffers from such reactions .
1867351	5	529	The incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions , compared with one of 13 , 000 in the prophylaxis group , making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after mefloquine treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis .
1867351	6	780	Therefore , certain limitations for malaria prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine are recommended .
18703024	0	0	Prenatal protein deprivation alters dopamine - mediated behaviors and dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptor binding .
18703024	1	117	Epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of schizophrenia .
18703024	2	230	The goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to schizophrenia .
18703024	3	405	We report that prenatally protein deprived ( PD ) female rats showed an increased stereotypic response to apomorphine and an increased locomotor response to amphetamine in adulthood .
18703024	4	586	These differences were not observed during puberty .
18703024	5	638	No changes in haloperidol - induced catalepsy or MK - 801 - induced locomotion were seen following PD .
18703024	6	735	In addition , PD female rats showed increased ( 3 ) H - MK - 801 binding in the striatum and hippocampus , but not in the cortex .
18703024	7	856	PD female rats also showed increased ( 3 ) H - haloperidol binding and decreased dopamine transporter binding in striatum .
18703024	8	974	No statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in PD males with the exception of increased ( 3 ) H - MK - 801 binding in cortex .
18703024	9	1129	This animal model may be useful to explore the mechanisms by which prenatal nutritional deficiency enhances risk for schizophrenia in humans and may also have implications for developmental processes leading to differential sensitivity to drugs of abuse .
18726058	0	0	Adverse effects of topical papaverine on auditory nerve function .
18726058	1	66	BACKGROUND : Papaverine hydrochloride is a direct - acting vasodilator used to manage vasospasm during various neurosurgical operations .
18726058	2	200	Transient cranial nerve dysfunction has been described in a few cases with topical papaverine .
18726058	3	295	This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve .
18726058	4	417	METHODS : We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical papaverine for vasospasm .
18726058	5	593	Topical papaverine was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage vasospasm in a total of 11 patients .
18726058	6	699	The timing of papaverine application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings .
18726058	7	832	Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEPs ) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations .
18726058	8	957	FINDINGS : A temporal relationship was found between topical papaverine and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss .
18726058	9	1080	The average temporal delay between papaverine and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min .
18726058	10	1177	In 10 of 11 patients , BAEP waves II / III - V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after papaverine .
18726058	11	1279	Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min .
18726058	12	1357	One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound sensorineural hearing loss .
18726058	13	1454	The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre - papaverine baseline values was 39 min .
18726058	14	1544	CONCLUSIONS : Topical papaverine for the treatment of vasospasm was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway .
18726058	15	1740	The complete disappearance of BAEP waveforms with a consistent temporal delay suggests a possible adverse effect on the proximal eighth nerve .
18726058	16	1883	Recommendations to avoid potential cranial nerve deficits from papaverine are provided .
18752389	0	0	Simvastatin - ezetimibe - induced hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation .
18752389	1	83	Abstract Serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) therapy .
18752389	2	241	However , hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin - ezetimibe .
18752389	3	363	We describe a 70 - year - old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg / day to simvastatin 10 mg - ezetimibe 40 mg / day .
18752389	4	575	The patient ' s lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity .
18752389	5	710	A routine laboratory work - up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels .
18752389	6	814	Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram ( which she was taking for depression ) were discontinued , and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded .
18752389	7	969	A repeat work - up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels , and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate - to - severe drug toxicity .
18752389	8	1114	She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course .
18752389	9	1191	Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23 , and her 2 - year follow - up showed no adverse events .
18752389	10	1314	Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases ( UGT ) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid , resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity .
18752389	11	1588	To our knowledge , this is the first case report of simvastatin - ezetimibe - induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation .
18752389	12	1723	We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe - induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes .
18752389	13	1884	Clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity with simvastatin - ezetimibe especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage .
18754075	0	0	Massive proteinuria and acute renal failure after oral bisphosphonate ( alendronate ) administration in a patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis .
18754075	1	153	A 61 - year - old Japanese man with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy .
18754075	2	296	The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15 . 6 to 2 . 8 g . Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate ( alendronate sodium ) administration , the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12 . 8 g with acute renal failure .
18754075	3	534	After discontinuing the oral alendronate , the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis .
18754075	4	659	Urinary volume and serum creatinine levels recovered to the normal range , with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days .
18754075	5	794	This report demonstrates that not only intravenous , but also oral bisphosphonates can aggravate proteinuria and acute renal failure .
18768591	0	0	Serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase 1 in doxorubicin - induced nephrotic syndrome .
18768591	1	88	Doxorubicin - induced nephropathy leads to epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) - dependent volume retention and renal fibrosis .
18768591	2	209	The aldosterone - sensitive serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and salt excess .
18768591	3	415	The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome .
18768591	4	541	To this end , doxorubicin ( 15 mug / g body wt ) was injected intravenously into gene - targeted mice lacking SGK1 ( sgk1 ( - / - ) ) and their wild - type littermates ( sgk1 ( + / + ) ) .
18768591	5	706	Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria ( > 100 mg protein / mg crea ) in 15 / 44 of sgk1 ( + / + ) and 15 / 44 of sgk1 ( - / - ) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites , lipidemia , and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes .
18768591	6	935	Plasma aldosterone levels increased in nephrotic mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice .
18768591	7	1080	Urinary sodium excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice ( 15 + / - 5 mumol / mg crea ) than in sgk1 ( - / - ) mice ( 35 + / - 5 mumol / mg crea ) and was associated with a significantly higher body weight gain in sgk1 ( + / + ) compared with sgk1 ( - / - ) mice ( + 6 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 vs . + 4 . 1 + / - 0 . 8 g ) .
18768591	8	1371	During the course of nephrotic syndrome , serum urea concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk1 ( - / - ) mice than in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice leading to uremia and a reduced median survival in sgk1 ( - / - ) mice ( 29 vs . 40 days in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice ) .
18768591	9	1612	In conclusion , gene - targeted mice lacking SGK1 showed blunted volume retention , yet were not protected against renal fibrosis during experimental nephrotic syndrome .
18791946	0	0	Severe thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia associated with ciprofloxacin : a case report with fatal outcome .
18791946	1	112	Haematological adverse reactions associated with fatal outcome are rare during treatment with ciprofloxacin .
18791946	2	221	A 30 - year old Caucasian man reported with abdominal pain and jaundice after 3 - day administration of oral ciprofloxacin for a suspect of urinary tract infection .
18791946	3	382	Clinical evaluations suggested an initial diagnosis of severe thrombocytopenia and haemolysis .
18791946	4	477	The patient progressively developed petechiae and purpura on thorax and lower limbs .
18791946	5	562	Despite pharmacological and supportive interventions , laboratory parameters worsened and the patient died 17 hours after admission .
18791946	6	694	An accurate autopsy revealed most organs with diffuse petechial haemorrhages .
18791946	7	772	No signs of bone marrow depression were found .
18791946	8	819	No thrombi or signs of microangiopathies were observed in arterial vessels .
18791946	9	895	Blood and urine cultures did not show any bacterial growth .
18791946	10	955	This case report shows that ciprofloxacin may precipitate life - threatening thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia , even in the early phases of treatment and without apparent previous exposures .
18809400	0	0	Alpha - lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy .
18809400	1	107	The study investigates if alpha - lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity , if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade , and if neuroprotective effects of alpha - lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection .
18809400	2	383	We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin , two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs .
18809400	3	661	This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha - lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha - lipoic acid .
18809400	4	891	Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons .
18809400	5	1068	Alpha - lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons : it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin , an essential mitochondrial protein with anti - oxidant and chaperone properties .
18809400	6	1337	In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity .
18809400	7	1455	Alpha - lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti - oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions , possibly inducing the expression of frataxin .
18809400	8	1609	These findings suggest that alpha - lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials .
18821488	0	0	Toxicity in rhesus monkeys following administration of the 8 - aminoquinoline 8 - [ ( 4 - amino - l - methylbutyl ) amino ] - 5 - ( l - hexyloxy ) - 6 - methoxy - 4 - methylquinoline ( WR242511 ) .
18821488	1	165	INTRODUCTION : Many substances that form methemoglobin ( MHb ) effectively counter cyanide ( CN ) toxicity .
18821488	2	268	Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning , it has been proposed that a stable , long - acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment .
18821488	3	436	Using this rationale , the 8 - aminoquinoline WR242511 , a potent long - lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs , was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment .
18821488	4	640	METHODS : In this study , WR242511 was administered intravenously ( IV ) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3 . 5 and / or 7 . 0 mg / kg ; a single male also received WR242511 orally ( PO ) at 7 . 0 mg / kg .
18821488	5	844	Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure .
18821488	6	908	RESULTS : The selected doses of WR242511 , which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere , produced very little MHb ( mean < 2 . 0 % ) in the rhesus monkey .
18821488	7	1110	Furthermore , transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 ( 3 . 5 or 7 . 0 mg / kg ) , and 2 lethalities occurred ( one IV and one PO ) following the 7 . 0 mg / kg dose .
18821488	8	1306	Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7 . 0 mg / kg dose .
18821488	9	1368	Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity , with greater severity in the orally - treated animal .
18821488	10	1507	CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate direct and / or indirect drug - induced toxicity .
18821488	11	1589	It is concluded that WR242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN poisoning unless the anti - CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable toxicity .
18951540	0	0	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for levodopa - induced dyskinesias in Parkinson ' s disease .
18951540	1	102	In a placebo - controlled , single - blinded , crossover study , we assessed the effect of " real " repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) versus " sham " rTMS ( placebo ) on peak dose dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) .
18951540	2	342	Ten patients with PD and prominent dyskinesias had rTMS ( 1 , 800 pulses ; 1 Hz rate ) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice , once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used ; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series .
18951540	3	636	Direct comparison between sham and real rTMS effects showed no significant difference in clinician - assessed dyskinesia severity .
18951540	4	765	However , comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in dyskinesia severity following real rTMS but not placebo .
18951540	5	902	The major effect was on dystonia subscore .
18951540	6	945	Similarly , in patient diaries , although both treatments caused reduction in subjective dyskinesia scores during the days of intervention , the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rTMS only .
18951540	7	1166	Following rTMS , no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and PD symptoms were noted .
18951540	8	1267	The results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low - frequency rTMS on dyskinesias in PD .
18951540	9	1424	The effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses .
18996674	0	0	Intracavernous epinephrine : a minimally invasive treatment for priapism in the emergency department .
18996674	1	101	Priapism is the prolonged erection of the penis in the absence of sexual arousal .
18996674	2	183	A 45 - year - old man , an admitted frequent cocaine user , presented to the Emergency Department ( ED ) on two separate occasions with a history of priapism after cocaine use .
18996674	3	352	The management options in the ED , as exemplified by four individual case reports , in particular the use of a minimally invasive method of intracorporal epinephrine instillation , are discussed .
19037603	0	0	Prophylactic use of lamivudine with chronic immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatologic disorders .
19037603	1	99	The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBs Ag ) positive patients with rheumatologic disease .
19037603	2	326	From June 2004 to October 2006 , 11 HBs Ag positive patients with rheumatologic diseases , who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies , were retrospectively assessed .
19037603	3	520	Liver function tests , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) serologic markers , and HBV DNA levels of the patients during follow - up were obtained from hospital file records .
19037603	4	679	Eleven patients ( six male ) with median age 47 years ( range 27 - 73 ) , median disease duration 50 months ( range 9 - 178 ) and median follow - up period of patients 13 . 8 months ( range 5 - 27 ) were enrolled in this study .
19037603	5	888	Lamivudine therapy was started 3 - 7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients .
19037603	6	980	Baseline , liver function tests were elevated in two patients ( fourth patient : ALT : 122 IU / l , AST : 111 IU / l , tenth patient : ALT : 294 IU / l , AST : 274 IU / l , with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both ) .
19037603	7	1179	Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow - up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests .
19037603	8	1310	In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline .
19037603	9	1379	Two of these normalized and the others increased later .
19037603	10	1435	In three additional patients , HBV DNA levels were increased during follow - up .
19037603	11	1513	None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation .
19037603	12	1584	Lamivudine was well tolerated and was continued in all patients .
19037603	13	1649	Prophylactic administration of lamivudine in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe , well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation .
19058010	0	0	Effect of green tea and vitamin E combination in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats .
19058010	1	102	The present study was aimed to investigate the combined effects of green tea and vitamin E on heart weight , body weight , serum marker enzymes , lipid peroxidation , endogenous antioxidants and membrane bound ATPases in isoproterenol ( ISO ) - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
19058010	2	378	Adult male albino rats , treated with ISO ( 200 mg / kg , s . c . ) for 2 days at an interval of 24 h caused a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) elevation of heart weight , serum marker enzymes , lipid peroxidation and Ca + 2 ATPase level whereas there was a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) decrease in body weight , endogenous antioxidants , Na + / K + ATPase and Mg + 2 ATPase levels .
19058010	3	721	Administration of green tea ( 100 mg / kg / day , p . o . ) and vitamin E ( 100 mg / kg / day , p . o . ) together for 30 consecutive days and challenged with ISO on the day 29th and 30th , showed a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) decrease in heart weight , serum marker enzymes , lipid peroxidation , Ca + 2 ATPase and a significant increase in the body weight , endogenous antioxidants , Na + / K + ATPase and Mg + 2 ATPase when compared with ISO treated group and green tea or vitamin E alone treated groups .
19058010	4	1188	These findings indicate the synergistic protective effect of green tea and vitamin E during ISO induced myocardial infarction in rats .
1919871	0	0	Irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic nephropathy in F344 rats .
1919871	1	102	Renal papillary necrosis ( RPN ) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long - term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female Fischer 344 rats .
1919871	2	284	Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks , when no analgesics were given , to investigate whether the analgesic - induced changes were reversible .
1919871	3	484	There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix , or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment .
1919871	4	695	The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage .
1919871	5	857	During the early stages of analgesic treatment , the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible , but after prolonged analgesic treatment , maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover .
1919871	6	1065	This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to RPN .
1919871	7	1253	The associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla .
19211690	0	0	Testosterone - dependent hypertension and upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen in Dahl salt - sensitive rats .
19211690	1	112	Blood pressure ( BP ) is more salt sensitive in men than in premenopausal women .
19211690	2	191	In Dahl salt - sensitive rats ( DS ) , high - salt ( HS ) diet increases BP more in males than females .
19211690	3	286	In contrast to the systemic renin - angiotensin system , which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS , intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased , and intrarenal levels of ANG II are not suppressed .
19211690	4	494	In this study , the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS - induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in BP and renal injury .
19211690	5	702	On a low - salt ( LS ) diet , male DS had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mRNA than females .
19211690	6	802	HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS , which was prevented by castration .
19211690	7	929	Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet .
19211690	8	1025	Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet .
19211690	9	1101	HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP , protein and albumin excretion , and glomerular sclerosis in male DS rats , which were attenuated by castration .
19211690	10	1265	Testosterone replacement in castrated DS rats increased BP , renal injury , and upregulation of renal angiotensinogen associated with HS diet .
19211690	11	1406	Testosterone contributes to the development of hypertension and renal injury in male DS rats on HS diet possibly through upregulation of the intrarenal renin - angiotensin system .
19269743	0	0	Explicit episodic memory for sensory - discriminative components of capsaicin - induced pain : immediate and delayed ratings .
19269743	1	121	Pain memory is thought to affect future pain sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical pain conditions .
19269743	2	227	Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are sparse .
19269743	3	337	In order to address long - term pain memory , nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin ( 0 . 05 , 1 and 20 microg , separated by 15 min breaks ) , each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals .
19269743	4	611	Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale ( 0 - 100 ) digitized at 1 / s , either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection .
19269743	5	772	Subjects also recalled their pains one week later .
19269743	6	823	Capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose - dependent flare ( p < 0 . 001 ) without any difference within or across sessions .
19269743	7	943	The strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes .
19269743	8	1011	Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses ( both p < 0 . 001 ) , regardless of whether first - time ratings were requested immediately , after one hour or after one day .
19269743	9	1224	Pain recall after one week was similarly precise ( magnitude : p < 0 . 01 , duration : p < 0 . 05 ) .
19269743	10	1312	Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first - time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection ( R ( 2 ) = 0 . 79 ) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces .
19269743	11	1524	These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced pain .
19269743	12	1624	The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage , and may take up to one day .
19299179	0	0	Severe and long lasting cholestasis after high - dose co - trimoxazole treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV - infected patients - - a report of two cases .
19299179	1	153	Pneumocystis pneumonia ( PCP ) , a common opportunistic infection in HIV - infected individuals , is generally treated with high doses of co - trimoxazole .
19299179	2	301	However , treatment is often limited by adverse effects .
19299179	3	357	Here , we report two cases of severely immunocompromised HIV - infected patients who developed severe intrahepatic cholestasis , and in one patient lesions mimicking liver abscess formation on radiologic exams , during co - trimoxazole treatment for PCP .
19299179	4	605	Whereas patient 1 showed lesions of up to 1 cm readily detectable on magnetic resonance imaging under prolonged co - trimoxazole treatment , therapy of patient 2 was switched early .
19300402	0	0	Bradykinin receptors antagonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors in vincristine and streptozotocin induced hyperalgesia in chemotherapy and diabetic neuropathy rat model .
19300402	1	176	PURPOSE : The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive NO synthase ( L - NOArg ; 1 . 0 mg / kg ip ) , a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase ( L - NIL ; 1 . 0 mg / kg ip ) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase ( 7 - NI ; 0 . 1 mg / kg ip ) , on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B2 and B1 receptors : D - Arg - [ Hyp3 , Thi5 , D - Tic7 , Oic8 ] bradykinin ( HOE 140 ; 70 nmol / kg ip ) or des Arg10 HOE 140 ( 70 nmol / kg ip ) respectively , in model of diabetic ( streptozotocin - induced ) and toxic ( vincristine - induced ) neuropathy was investigated .
19300402	2	743	METHODS : The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli - - the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall - Selitto .
19300402	3	907	RESULTS : The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia .
19300402	4	1085	Pretreatment with L - NOArg and L - NIL but not 7 - NI , significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140 .
19300402	5	1221	It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine .
19300402	6	1395	Moreover , L - NOArg and 7 - NI but not L - NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des - Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy .
19300402	7	1524	CONCLUSIONS : Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy .
19300402	8	1685	In streptozotocin - induced hyperalgesia , inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin , whereas in vincristine - induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway .
19300402	9	1906	Therefore , concomitant administration of small doses of bradykinin receptor antagonists and NO synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of neuropathic pain , even in hospital care .
19308880	0	0	Confusion , a rather serious adverse drug reaction with valproic acid : a review of the French Pharmacovigilance database .
19308880	1	121	INTRODUCTION : Confusion is an adverse drug reaction frequently observed with valproic acid .
19308880	2	213	Some case reports are published in the literature but no systematic study from a sample of patients has been published .
19308880	3	333	We performed this study in order to describe the main characteristics of this adverse drug reaction .
19308880	4	434	METHODS : Using the French Pharmacovigilance database , we selected the cases of confusion reported since 1985 with valproic acid .
19308880	5	563	RESULTS : 272 cases of confusion were reported with valproic acid : 153 women and 119 men .
19308880	6	652	Confusion mostly occurred during the two first weeks following valproic acid exposure ( 39 . 7 % ) .
19308880	7	747	It was " serious " for almost 2 / 3 of the patients ( 62 . 5 % ) and its outcome favourable in most of the cases ( 82 % ) .
19308880	8	858	The occurrence of this ADR was more frequent in patients aged between 61 and 80 years .
19308880	9	945	CONCLUSION : This work shows that confusion with valproic acid is a serious , rather frequent but reversible adverse drug reaction .
19308880	10	1075	It occurs especially in older patients and during the first two weeks of treatment .
19346865	0	0	Reversible inferior colliculus lesion in metronidazole - induced encephalopathy : magnetic resonance findings on diffusion - weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging .
19346865	1	178	OBJECTIVE : This is to present reversible inferior colliculus lesions in metronidazole - induced encephalopathy , to focus on the diffusion - weighted imaging ( DWI ) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) imaging .
19346865	2	394	MATERIALS AND METHODS : From November 2005 to September 2007 , 8 patients ( 5 men and 3 women ) were diagnosed as having metronidazole - induced encephalopathy ( age range ; 43 - 78 years ) .
19346865	3	574	They had been taking metronidazole ( total dosage , 45 - 120 g ; duration , 30 days to 2 months ) to treat the infection in various organs .
19346865	4	707	Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) were obtained after the hospitalization , including DWI ( 8 / 8 ) , apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) map ( 4 / 8 ) , FLAIR ( 7 / 8 ) , and T2 - weighted image ( 8 / 8 ) .
19346865	5	906	Follow - up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration .
19346865	6	1029	Findings of initial and follow - up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus , to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities , their locations , and signal changes on follow - up images .
19346865	7	1249	RESULTS : Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR ( or T2 - weighted image ) at the dentate nucleus ( 8 / 8 ) , inferior colliculus ( 6 / 8 ) , corpus callosum ( 2 / 8 ) , pons ( 2 / 8 ) , medulla ( 1 / 8 ) , and bilateral cerebral white matter ( 1 / 8 ) .
19346865	8	1501	High - signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map ( 3 / 4 ) , but in one patient , high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map .
19346865	9	1706	All the lesions in dentate , inferior colliculus , pons , and medullas had been resolved completely on follow - up MRIs in 5 patients , but in 1 patient of them , corpus callosal lesion persisted .
19346865	10	1896	CONCLUSIONS : Reversible inferior colliculus lesions could be considered as the characteristic for metronidazole - induced encephalopathy , next to the dentate nucleus involvement .
19356053	0	0	Clinically significant proteinuria following the administration of sirolimus to renal transplant recipients .
19356053	1	109	BACKGROUND : Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection , and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) - based regimens .
19356053	2	278	To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus .
19356053	3	394	We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use .
19356053	4	500	In each patient , the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria .
19356053	5	679	METHODS : We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999 - 2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen .
19356053	6	907	In these patients , the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein : creatinine ratios , an estimate of grams of proteinuria / day .
19356053	7	1106	Laboratory results were compared between prior , during and following sirolimus use .
19356053	8	1190	RESULTS : Twenty - eight patients ( 24 % ) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post - transplantation course .
19356053	9	1315	In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive .
19356053	10	1438	In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic - range proteinuria .
19356053	11	1592	Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables .
19356053	12	1711	In most patients , discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease , but not resolution , of proteinuria .
19356053	13	1818	CONCLUSIONS : Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre - existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients .
19356053	14	1946	Proteinuria may improve , but does not resolve , when sirolimus is withdrawn .
19356307	0	0	Components of lemon essential oil attenuate dementia induced by scopolamine .
19356307	1	77	The anti - dementia effects of s - limonene and s - perillyl alcohol were observed using the passive avoidance test ( PA ) and the open field habituation test ( OFH ) .
19356307	2	235	These lemon essential oils showed strong ability to improve memory impaired by scopolamine ; however , s - perillyl alcohol relieved the deficit of associative memory in PA only , and did not improve non - associative memory significantly in OFH .
19356307	3	475	Analysis of neurotransmitter concentration in some brain regions on the test day showed that dopamine concentration of the vehicle / scopolamine group was significantly lower than that of the vehicle / vehicle group , but this phenomenon was reversed when s - limonene or s - perillyl alcohol were administered before the injection of scopolamine .
19356307	4	814	Simultaneously , we found that these two lemon essential oil components could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro using the Ellman method .
19387625	0	0	Attentional modulation of perceived pain intensity in capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia .
19387625	1	96	Perceived pain intensity is modulated by attention .
19387625	2	148	However , it is not known that how pain intensity ratings are affected by attention in capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia .
19387625	3	276	Here we show that perceived pain intensity in secondary hyperalgesia is decreased when attention is distracted away from the painful pinprick stimulus with a visual task .
19387625	4	447	Furthermore , it was found that the magnitude of attentional modulation in secondary hyperalgesia is very similar to that of capsaicin - untreated , control condition .
19387625	5	611	Our findings , showing no interaction between capsaicin treatment and attentional modulation suggest that capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia and attention might affect mechanical pain through independent mechanisms .
19445921	0	0	Cardioprotective effect of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
19445921	1	102	The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
19445921	2	254	Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously .
19445921	3	350	Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured .
19445921	4	444	Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed .
19445921	5	556	Isoproterenol - treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate transaminase , creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase , catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart .
19445921	6	837	These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure , maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure , and elevation of left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and ST - segment .
19445921	7	1046	In addition , mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP / O was observed in isoproterenol - treated rats .
19445921	8	1204	Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol - induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function .
19445921	9	1402	The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol - induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination .
19445921	10	1548	The results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid A possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction .
19473225	0	0	Long - term glutamate supplementation failed to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of paclitaxel .
19473225	1	102	Toxic peripheral neuropathy is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with paclitaxel ( PAC ) , although glutamate and its closely related amino acid glutamine were claimed to ameliorate PAC neurotoxicity .
19473225	2	319	This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of glutamate supplementation for preventing PAC - induced peripheral neuropathy in a randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blinded clinical and electro - diagnostic study .
19473225	3	532	Forty - three ovarian cancer patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same PAC - containing regimen : 23 had been supplemented by glutamate all along the treatment period , at a daily dose of three times 500 mg ( group G ) , and 20 had received a placebo ( group P ) .
19473225	4	813	Patients were evaluated by neurological examinations , questionnaires and sensory - motor nerve conduction studies .
19473225	5	926	There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although neurotoxicity symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G . However , this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported pain sensation ( P = 0 . 011 ) .
19473225	6	1229	Also the frequency of abnormal electro - diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups ( G : 7 / 23 = 30 . 4 % ; P : 6 / 20 = 30 % ) .
19473225	7	1363	This pilot study leads to the conclusion that glutamate supplementation at the chosen regimen fails to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of PAC .
19581773	0	0	Development of ocular myasthenia during pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C .
19581773	1	110	A 63 - year - old male experienced sudden diplopia after 9 weeks of administration of pegylated interferon ( IFN ) alpha - 2b and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) .
19581773	2	273	Ophthalmologic examinations showed ptosis on the right upper lid and restricted right eye movement without any other neurological signs .
19581773	3	410	A brain imaging study and repetitive nerve stimulation test indicated no abnormality .
19581773	4	496	The acetylcholine receptor antibody titer and response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were negative , and the results of thyroid function tests were normal .
19581773	5	656	The patient ' s ophthalmological symptoms improved rapidly 3 weeks after discontinuation of pegylated IFN alpha - 2b and ribavirin .
19581773	6	784	The ocular myasthenia associated with combination therapy of pegylated IFN alpha - 2b and ribavirin for CHC is very rarely reported ; therefore , we present this case with a review of the various eye complications of IFN therapy .
19631624	0	0	Learning and memory deficits in ecstasy users and their neural correlates during a face - learning task .
19631624	1	103	It has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance .
19631624	2	209	In addition , working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and / or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
19631624	3	421	Using functional imaging and a face - learning task , we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face - name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls .
19631624	4	641	To address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group , a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users ( Nestor , L . , Roberts , G . , Garavan , H . , Hester , R . , 2008 .
19631624	5	854	Deficits in learning and memory : parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users .
19631624	6	968	Neuroimage 40 , 1328 - 1339 ) .
19631624	7	995	Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users .
19631624	8	1103	A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy - specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions , left temporal , right parietal , bilateral temporal , and bilateral occipital brain regions .
19631624	9	1330	Ecstasy - specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex ( ACC ) and left posterior cingulated cortex .
19631624	10	1463	In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus , left parahippocampal gyrus , left dorsal cingulate gyrus , and left caudate .
19631624	11	1640	These results elucidated ecstasy - related deficits , only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use .
19631624	12	1747	These ecstasy - specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy .
19657887	0	0	Disulfiram - like syndrome after hydrogen cyanamide professional skin exposure : two case reports in France .
19657887	1	106	Hydrogen cyanamide is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit trees .
19657887	2	209	Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can induce acetaldehyde syndrome in case of alcohol use .
19657887	3	384	The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a disulfiram - like syndrome following occupational exposure to hydrogen cyanamide .
19657887	4	521	The first case involved a 59 - year - old man who used Dormex , which contains hydrogen cyanamide , without protection after consuming a large amount of alcohol during a meal .
19657887	5	691	In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of alcohol , he developed malaise with flushing of the face , tachycardia , and dyspnea .
19657887	6	817	Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital .
19657887	7	892	The second case occurred in a 55 - year - old farmer following cutaneous contact with Dormex .
19657887	8	982	Five hours after exposure , he developed disulfiram - like syndrome with flushing , tachycardia , and arterial hypotension after consuming three glasses of wine .
19657887	9	1139	The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital .
19657887	10	1222	These cases confirm the necessity of avoiding alcohol consumption as recommended in the instructions for use of Dormex and of preventing cutaneous contact during use .
1967484	0	0	Sulpiride - induced tardive dystonia .
1967484	1	36	Sulpiride is a selective D2 - receptor antagonist with antipsychotic and antidepressant properties .
1967484	2	134	Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects , sulpiride - induced tardive dyskinesia and parkinsonism have been reported occasionally .
1967484	3	291	We studied a 37 - year - old man who developed persistent segmental dystonia within 2 months after starting sulpiride therapy .
1967484	4	414	We could not find any previous reports of sulpiride - induced tardive dystonia .
19729346	0	0	Comparative cognitive and subjective side effects of immediate - release oxycodone in healthy middle - aged and older adults .
19729346	1	122	This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10 - mg dose of immediate - release oxycodone in healthy , older ( > 65 years ) , and middle - aged ( 35 to 55 years ) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain .
19729346	2	383	Seventy - one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition ( placebo , 10 - mg oxycodone ) .
19729346	3	507	Plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose ( P < . 01 ) and pupil size , an indication of physiological effects of the medication , peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose ( P < . 01 ) .
19729346	4	726	Significant declines in simple and sustained attention , working memory , and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose .
19729346	5	950	For almost all cognitive measures , there were no medication by age - interaction effects , which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge .
19729346	6	1133	This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic pain , neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10 - mg dose of immediate - release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle - aged adults .
19729346	7	1380	PERSPECTIVE : Study findings indicate that the metabolism , neurocognitive effects , and physical side effects of oral oxycodone are similar for healthy middle - aged and older adults .
19729346	8	1560	Therefore , clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults .
19759529	0	0	The glycine transporter - 1 inhibitor SSR103800 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic - like profile in normal and transgenic mice .
19759529	1	138	Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission .
19759529	2	230	However , the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor produce schizophrenic - like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor .
19759529	3	463	As a result , there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor .
19759529	4	682	Among them are glycine transporter - 1 ( GlyT1 ) inhibitors such as SSR103800 , which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine ( a co - agonist for the NMDA receptor ) levels in the synapse .
19759529	5	891	This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic - like properties of SSR103800 , with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity , involving either drug challenge ( ie , amphetamine and MK - 801 ) or transgenic mice ( ie , NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / - ) and DAT ( - / - ) ) .
19759529	6	1152	Results showed that SSR103800 ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non - competitive NMDA receptor antagonist , MK - 801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / - ) mice .
19759529	7	1362	In contrast , SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter ( DAT ( - / - ) ) knockout mice ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) .
19759529	8	1530	Importantly , both classical ( haloperidol ) and atypical ( olanzapine , clozapine and aripiprazole ) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity .
19759529	9	1694	However , unlike these latter , SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy ( retention on the bar test ) up to 30 mg / kg p . o . Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor , SSR103800 , produces antipsychotic - like effects , which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system , and has a reduced side - effect potential as compared with these latter drugs .
19767176	0	0	Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate protects the piriform cortex in the pilocarpine status epilepticus model .
19767176	1	102	Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) has a dual mechanism of action as an antioxidant and an inhibitor of the transcription factor kappa - beta .
19767176	2	243	Both , production of reactive oxygen species as well as activation of NF - kappaB have been implicated in severe neuronal damage in different sub - regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortices .
19767176	3	453	The effect of PDTC on status epilepticus - associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine model .
19767176	4	611	Treatment with 150 mg / kg PDTC before and following status epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100 % .
19767176	5	733	Administration of 50 mg / kg PDTC ( low - dose ) did not exert major effects on the development of a status epilepticus or the mortality rate .
19767176	6	870	In vehicle - treated rats , status epilepticus caused pronounced neuronal damage in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons .
19767176	7	1021	Low - dose PDTC treatment almost completely protected from lesions in the piriform cortex .
19767176	8	1110	A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle - and PDTC - treated rats following status epilepticus .
19767176	9	1267	In conclusion , the NF - kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant PDTC protected the piriform cortex , whereas it did not affect hilar neuronal loss .
19767176	10	1405	These data might indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF - kappaB plays a more central role in seizure - associated neuronal damage in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus .
19767176	11	1631	However , future investigations are necessary to exactly analyze the biochemical mechanisms by which PDTC exerted its beneficial effects in the piriform cortex .
19803309	0	0	Anaesthetists ' nightmare : masseter spasm after induction in an undiagnosed case of myotonia congenita .
19803309	1	103	We report an undiagnosed case of myotonia congenita in a 24 - year - old previously healthy primigravida , who developed life threatening masseter spasm following a standard dose of intravenous suxamethonium for induction of anaesthesia .
19803309	2	336	Neither the patient nor the anaesthetist was aware of the diagnosis before this potentially lethal complication occurred .
19820426	0	0	Twin preterm neonates with cardiac toxicity related to lopinavir / ritonavir therapy .
19820426	1	84	We report twin neonates who were born prematurely at 32 weeks of gestation to a mother with human immunodeficiency virus infection .
19820426	2	216	One of the twins developed complete heart block and dilated cardiomyopathy related to lopinavir / ritonavir therapy , a boosted protease - inhibitor agent , while the other twin developed mild bradycardia .
19820426	3	416	We recommend caution in the use of lopinavir / ritonavir in the immediate neonatal period .
19843802	0	0	When drugs disappear from the patient : elimination of intravenous medication by hemodiafiltration .
19843802	1	99	Twenty - three hours after heart transplantation , life - threatening acute right heart failure was diagnosed in a patient requiring continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) .
19843802	2	277	Increasing doses of catecholamines , sedatives , and muscle relaxants administered through a central venous catheter were ineffective .
19843802	3	410	However , a bolus of epinephrine injected through an alternative catheter provoked a hypertensive crisis .
19843802	4	515	Thus , interference with the central venous infusion by the dialysis catheter was suspected .
19843802	5	607	The catheters were changed , and hemodynamics stabilized at lower catecholamine doses .
19843802	6	693	When the effects of IV drugs are inadequate in patients receiving CVVHDF , interference with adjacent catheters resulting in elimination of the drug by CVVHDF should be suspected .
1987816	0	0	Less frequent lithium administration and lower urine volume .
1987816	1	61	OBJECTIVE : This study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of lithium on a once - per - day schedule have lower urine volumes than do patients receiving multiple doses per day .
1987816	2	264	METHOD : This was a cross - sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose schedules .
1987816	3	381	Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level , creatinine clearance , urine volume , and maximum osmolality .
1987816	4	514	RESULTS : Multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes .
1987816	5	598	The dosing schedule , duration of lithium treatment , and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance .
1987816	6	735	CONCLUSIONS : Urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and / or by lowering the total daily dose .
1987816	7	846	Lithium - induced polyuria seems to be related to extrarenal as well as to renal effects .
19884587	0	0	Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of birth defects : National Birth Defects Prevention Study .
19884587	1	114	OBJECTIVE : To estimate the association between antibacterial medications and selected birth defects .
19884587	2	215	DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : Population - based , multisite , case - control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major birth defects identified via birth defect surveillance programs in 10 states ( n = 13 155 ) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions ( n = 4941 ) .
19884587	3	545	MAIN EXPOSURE : Reported maternal use of antibacterials ( 1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester ) .
19884587	4	667	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Odds ratios ( ORs ) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected birth defects adjusted for potential confounders .
19884587	5	822	RESULTS : The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy , peaking during the third month .
19884587	6	926	Sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly ( adjusted OR [ AOR ] = 3 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1 . 3 - 8 . 8 ) , hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( AOR = 3 . 2 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 3 - 7 . 6 ) , coarctation of the aorta ( AOR = 2 . 7 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 3 - 5 . 6 ) , choanal atresia ( AOR = 8 . 0 ; 95 % CI , 2 . 7 - 23 . 5 ) , transverse limb deficiency ( AOR = 2 . 5 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 0 - 5 . 9 ) , and diaphragmatic hernia ( AOR = 2 . 4 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 5 . 4 ) .
19884587	7	1314	Nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos ( AOR = 3 . 7 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 12 . 2 ) , hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( AOR = 4 . 2 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 9 - 9 . 1 ) , atrial septal defects ( AOR = 1 . 9 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 3 . 4 ) , and cleft lip with cleft palate ( AOR = 2 . 1 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 2 - 3 . 9 ) .
19884587	8	1589	Other antibacterial agents that showed associations included erythromycins ( 2 defects ) , penicillins ( 1 defect ) , cephalosporins ( 1 defect ) , and quinolones ( 1 defect ) .
19884587	9	1755	CONCLUSIONS : Reassuringly , penicillins , erythromycins , and cephalosporins , although used commonly by pregnant women , were not associated with many birth defects .
19884587	10	1917	Sulfonamides and nitrofurantoins were associated with several birth defects , indicating a need for additional scrutiny .
19889778	0	0	Differential impact of immune escape mutations G145R and P120T on the replication of lamivudine - resistant hepatitis B virus e antigen - positive and - negative strains .
19889778	1	166	Immune escape variants of the hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) represent an emerging clinical challenge , because they can be associated with vaccine escape , HBV reactivation , and failure of diagnostic tests .
19889778	2	365	Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals .
19889778	3	512	We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants , the sG145R and sP120T mutants , on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment - associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine ( LAM ) and / or HBeAg negativity .
19889778	4	816	Replication - competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance ( rtM204I or rtL180M / rtM204V ) were generated on an HBeAg - positive and an HBeAg - negative background with precore ( PC ) and basal core promoter ( BCP ) mutants .
19889778	5	1046	The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM - resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild - type HBV , and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication .
19889778	6	1272	Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion , it did not enhance the replication of LAM - resistant clones .
19889778	7	1396	However , the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity ( PC / BCP ) , sP120T , and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild - type HBV .
19889778	8	1560	In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations , the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro .
19889778	9	1742	These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants , supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns .
1992636	0	0	Hemolytic anemia associated with the use of omeprazole .
1992636	1	56	Omeprazole is the first drug designed to block the final step in the acid secretory process within the parietal cell .
1992636	2	174	It has been shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease , reflux esophagitis , and the Zollinger - Ellison syndrome .
1992636	3	316	Although clinical experience with omeprazole is still limited , many controlled studies have established the short - term safety of this drug .
1992636	4	456	We report the first case of a serious short - term adverse reaction with the use of omeprazole : hemolytic anemia .
1992636	5	568	The patient developed weakness , lethargy , and shortness of breath 2 days after starting therapy with omeprazole .
1992636	6	681	Two weeks after the initiation of therapy , her hematocrit had decreased from 44 . 1 % to 20 . 4 % , and she had a positive direct Coombs antiglobulin test and an elevated indirect bilirubin .
1992636	7	865	After she discontinued the omeprazole , her hemoglobin and hematocrit gradually returned to normal .
1992636	8	964	The mechanism by which omeprazole caused the patient ' s hemolytic anemia is uncertain , but physicians should be alerted to this possible adverse effect .
19957053	0	0	Phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces frontal lobe oxygenation following anesthesia - induced hypotension .
19957053	1	107	BACKGROUND : Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia - induced hypotension .
19957053	2	190	We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ) following anesthesia - induced hypotension .
19957053	3	325	METHODS : Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl ( 0 . 15 mg kg ( - 1 ) ) and propofol ( 2 . 0 mg kg ( - 1 ) ) , 13 patients received phenylephrine ( 0 . 1 mg iv ) and 12 patients received ephedrine ( 10 mg iv ) to restore mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) .
19957053	4	561	Heart rate ( HR ) , MAP , stroke volume ( SV ) , cardiac output ( CO ) , and frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ) were registered .
19957053	5	681	RESULTS : Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP , HR , SV , and CO concomitant with an elevation in S ( c ) O ( 2 ) .
19957053	6	807	After administration of phenylephrine , MAP increased ( 51 + / - 12 to 81 + / - 13 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ; mean + / - SD ) .
19957053	7	915	However , a 14 % ( from 70 + / - 8 % to 60 + / - 7 % ) reduction in S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) followed with no change in CO ( 3 . 7 + / - 1 . 1 to 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 9 l min ( - 1 ) ) .
19957053	8	1063	The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP ( 53 + / - 9 to 79 + / - 8 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ) , restored CO ( 3 . 2 + / - 1 . 2 to 5 . 0 + / - 1 . 3 l min ( - 1 ) ) , and preserved S ( c ) O ( 2 ) .
19957053	9	1244	CONCLUSIONS : The utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S ( c ) O ( 2 ) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO .
20003049	0	0	Prolonged elevation of plasma argatroban in a cardiac transplant patient with a suspected history of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis .
20003049	1	151	BACKGROUND : Direct thrombin inhibitors ( DTIs ) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) or HIT with thrombosis ( HITT ) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) .
20003049	2	387	In the following report , a 65 - year - old critically ill patient with a suspected history of HITT was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation .
20003049	3	570	The patient required massive transfusion support ( 55 units of red blood cells , 42 units of fresh - frozen plasma , 40 units of cryoprecipitate , 40 units of platelets , and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa ) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding .
20003049	4	832	STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for argatroban concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time ( ECT ) assay .
20003049	5	1009	RESULTS : Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples ( range , 0 - 32 microg / mL ) , and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life ( t ( 1 / 2 ) ) of 514 minutes was observed ( published elimination t ( 1 / 2 ) is 39 - 51 minutes [ < or = 181 minutes with hepatic impairment ] ) .
20003049	6	1296	CONCLUSIONS : Correlation of plasma argatroban concentration versus the patient ' s coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma argatroban may have contributed to the patient ' s extended coagulopathy .
20003049	7	1540	Because DTIs do not have reversal agents , surgical teams and transfusion services should remain aware of the possibility of massive transfusion events during anticoagulation with these agents .
20003049	8	1733	This is the first report to measure plasma argatroban concentration in the context of CPB and extended coagulopathy .
20067456	0	0	The effects of the adjunctive bupropion on male sexual dysfunction induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor : a double - blind placebo - controlled and randomized study .
20067456	1	176	OBJECTIVE : To determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive bupropion sustained - release ( SR ) on male sexual dysfunction ( SD ) induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , as SD is a common side - effect of SSRIs and the most effective treatments have yet to be determined .
20067456	2	463	PATIENTS AND METHODS : The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of SSRI .
20067456	3	575	The men were randomly assigned to bupropion SR ( 150 mg twice daily , 117 ) or placebo ( twice daily , 117 ) for 12 weeks .
20067456	4	692	Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression - Sexual Function ( CGI - SF ; the primary outcome measure ) , the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF ) , Arizona Sexual Experience Scale ( ASEX ) , and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction ( EDITS ) ( secondary outcome measures ) .
20067456	5	999	Participants were followed biweekly during study period .
20067456	6	1056	RESULTS : After 12 weeks of treatment , the mean ( sd ) scores for CGI - SF were significantly lower , i . e . better , in patients on bupropion SR , at 2 . 4 ( 1 . 2 ) , than in the placebo group , at 3 . 9 ( 1 . 1 ) ( P = 0 . 01 ) .
20067456	7	1259	Men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total IIEF score ( 54 . 4 % vs 1 . 2 % ; P = 0 . 003 ) , and in the five different domains of the IIEF .
20067456	8	1411	Total ASEX scores were significantly lower , i . e . better , among men who received bupropion than placebo , at 15 . 5 ( 4 . 3 ) vs 21 . 5 ( 4 . 7 ) ( P = 0 . 002 ) .
20067456	9	1555	The EDITS scores were 67 . 4 ( 10 . 2 ) for the bupropion and 36 . 3 ( 11 . 7 ) for the placebo group ( P = 0 . 001 ) .
20067456	10	1657	The ASEX score and CGI - SF score were correlated ( P = 0 . 003 ) .
20067456	11	1717	In linear regression analyses the CGI - SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of SD , type of SSRI used and age .
20067456	12	1845	CONCLUSIONS : Bupropion is an effective treatment for male SD induced by SSRIs .
20067456	13	1924	These results provide empirical support for conducting a further study of bupropion .
20080419	0	0	Prevention of seizures and reorganization of hippocampal functions by transplantation of bone marrow cells in the acute phase of experimental epilepsy .
20080419	1	152	In this study , we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells ( BMCs ) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rats .
20080419	2	304	BMCs obtained from green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of status epilepticus ( SE ) .
20080419	3	455	Spontaneous recurrent seizures ( SRS ) were monitored using Racine ' s seizure severity scale .
20080419	4	546	All of the rats in the saline - treated epileptic control group developed SRS , whereas none of the BMC - treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term ( 15 days after transplantation ) , regardless of the BMC source .
20080419	5	767	Over the long - term chronic phase ( 120 days after transplantation ) , only 25 % of BMC - treated epileptic animals had seizures , but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group .
20080419	6	971	The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved .
20080419	7	1073	At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral - CA1 synapses , long - term potentiation was preserved in BMC - transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls .
20080419	8	1217	The donor - derived GFP ( + ) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rats .
20080419	9	1312	In conclusion , treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic seizures , reduce neuronal loss , and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network .
20080983	0	0	Normalizing effects of modafinil on sleep in chronic cocaine users .
20080983	1	68	OBJECTIVE : The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of morning - dosed modafinil on sleep and daytime sleepiness in chronic cocaine users .
20080983	2	225	METHOD : Twenty cocaine - dependent participants were randomly assigned to receive modafinil , 400 mg ( N = 10 ) , or placebo ( N = 10 ) every morning at 7 : 30 a . m . for 16 days in an inpatient , double - blind randomized trial .
20080983	3	436	Participants underwent polysomnographic sleep recordings on days 1 to 3 , 7 to 9 , and 14 to 16 ( first , second , and third weeks of abstinence ) .
20080983	4	578	The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was performed at 11 : 30 a . m . , 2 : 00 p . m . , and 4 : 30 p . m . on days 2 , 8 , and 15 .
20080983	5	686	For comparison of sleep architecture variables , 12 healthy comparison participants underwent a single night of experimental polysomnography that followed 1 night of accommodation polysomnography .
20080983	6	882	RESULTS : Progressive abstinence from cocaine was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes .
20080983	7	1006	Compared with placebo , modafinil decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow - wave sleep time in cocaine - dependent participants .
20080983	8	1143	The effect of modafinil interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence .
20080983	9	1314	Comparison of slow - wave sleep time , total sleep time , and sleep latency in cocaine - dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of modafinil in cocaine - dependent participants .
20080983	10	1510	Modafinil was associated with increased daytime sleep latency , as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test , and a nearly significant decrease in subjective daytime sleepiness .
20080983	11	1689	CONCLUSIONS : Morning - dosed modafinil promotes nocturnal sleep , normalizes sleep architecture , and decreases daytime sleepiness in abstinent cocaine users .
20080983	12	1844	These effects may be relevant in the treatment of cocaine dependence .
20084309	0	0	Safety of transesophageal echocardiography in adults : study in a multidisciplinary hospital .
20084309	1	93	BACKGROUND : TEE is a semi - invasive tool broadly used and its utilization associated to sedatives drugs might to affect the procedure safety .
20084309	2	234	OBJECTIVE : to analyze aspects of TEE safety associated to the use of Midazolan ( MZ ) and Flumazenil ( FL ) and the influence of the clinical variables on the event rate .
20084309	3	401	METHOD : prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with MZ associated to moderate sedation .
20084309	4	505	We analyzed the following events : complications related with the topical anesthesia , with MZ use and with the procedure .
20084309	5	626	Uni - and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables : age , sex , stroke , myocardiopathy ( MP ) , duration of the test , mitral regurgitation ( MR ) and the MZ dose .
20084309	6	820	RESULTS : All patients ( 65 + / - 16 yrs ; 58 % males ) finished the examination .
20084309	7	893	The mean doses of MZ and FL were 4 . 3 + / - 1 . 9 mg and 0 . 28 + / - 0 . 2 mg , respectively .
20084309	8	972	The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction ( EF ) were 16 . 4 + / - 6 . 1 minutes and 60 + / - 9 % , respectively .
20084309	9	1091	Mild hypoxia ( SO2 < 90 % ) was the most common event ( 11 patients ) ; 3 patients ( 2 % ) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 ( 5 . 8 % ) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use .
20084309	10	1299	Transient hypotension ( SAP < 90mmHg ) occurred in 1 patient ( 0 . 7 % ) .
20084309	11	1364	The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR , MP ( EF < 45 % ) and high doses of MZ ( > 5mg ) were associated with events ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
20084309	12	1492	The EF was 40 % , in the group with MP and 44 % in the group with severe MR and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group .
20084309	13	1639	CONCLUSION : TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events .
20084309	14	1700	There were no severe events and there was no need to interrupt the examinations .
2008831	0	0	Effect of direct intracoronary administration of methylergonovine in patients with and without variant angina .
2008831	1	111	The effects of intracoronary administration of methylergonovine were studied in 21 patients with variant angina and 22 patients with atypical chest pain and in others without angina pectoris ( control group ) .
2008831	2	319	Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms / min up to 50 micrograms .
2008831	3	418	In all patients with variant angina , coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 + / - 13 micrograms ( mean + / - SD ) .
2008831	4	537	In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred .
2008831	5	615	The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery .
2008831	6	722	The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery .
2008831	7	850	These results suggest that spasm provocation tests , which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine , have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries .
20098969	0	0	Oral manifestations of " meth mouth " : a case report .
20098969	1	52	AIM : The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of " meth mouth " and the medical risks associated with this serious condition .
20098969	2	214	BACKGROUND : Methamphetamine is a very addictive , powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dysrhythmias , hypertension , hallucinations , and violent behavior .
20098969	3	443	Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene , xerostomia , rampant caries ( " meth mouth " ) , and excessive tooth wear .
20098969	4	588	Oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challenging .
20098969	5	662	CASE DESCRIPTION : A 30 - year - old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain , bad breath , and self - reported poor esthetics .
20098969	6	784	A comprehensive examination including her medical history , panoramic radiograph , and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions , which is not very common for a healthy adult .
20098969	7	966	She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug .
20098969	8	1107	SUMMARY : The patient ' s medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of " meth mouth . "
20098969	9	1242	Although three different dental treatment modalities ( either conventional or implant - supported ) have been offered to the patient since August 2007 , the patient has yet to initiate any treatment .
20098969	10	1437	CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE : This clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing methamphetamines .
20098969	11	1631	Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients , as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification .
20196116	0	0	Antituberculosis therapy - induced acute liver failure : magnitude , profile , prognosis , and predictors of outcome .
20196116	1	112	Antituberculosis therapy ( ATT ) - associated acute liver failure ( ATT - ALF ) is the commonest drug - induced ALF in South Asia .
20196116	2	233	Prospective studies on ATT - ALF are lacking .
20196116	3	277	The current study prospectively evaluated the magnitude , clinical course , outcome , and prognostic factors in ATT - ALF .
20196116	4	395	From January 1986 to January 2009 , 1223 consecutive ALF patients were evaluated : ATT alone was the cause in 70 ( 5 . 7 % ) patients .
20196116	5	523	Another 15 ( 1 . 2 % ) had ATT and simultaneous hepatitis virus infection .
20196116	6	593	In 44 ( 62 . 8 % ) patients , ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of tuberculosis .
20196116	7	693	ATT - ALF patients were younger ( 32 . 87 [ + / - 15 . 8 ] years ) , and 49 ( 70 % ) of them were women .
20196116	8	781	Most had hyperacute presentation ; the median icterus encephalopathy interval was 4 . 5 ( 0 - 30 ) days .
20196116	9	879	The median duration of ATT before ALF was 30 ( 7 - 350 ) days .
20196116	10	938	At presentation , advanced encephalopathy and cerebral edema were present in 51 ( 76 % ) and 29 ( 41 . 4 % ) patients , respectively .
20196116	11	1062	Gastrointestinal bleed , seizures , infection , and acute renal failure were documented in seven ( 10 % ) , five ( 7 . 1 % ) , 26 ( 37 . 1 % ) , and seven ( 10 % ) patients , respectively .
20196116	12	1228	Compared with hepatitis E virus ( HEV ) and non - A non - E - induced ALF , ATT - ALF patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes .
20196116	13	1403	The mortality rate among patients with ATT - ALF was high ( 67 . 1 % , n = 47 ) , and only 23 ( 32 . 9 % ) patients recovered with medical treatment .
20196116	14	1539	In multivariate analysis , three factors independently predicted mortality : serum bilirubin ( > or = 10 . 8 mg / dL ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) prolongation ( > or = 26 seconds ) , and grade III / IV encephalopathy at presentation .
20196116	15	1750	CONCLUSION : ATT - ALF constituted 5 . 7 % of ALF at our center and had a high mortality rate .
20196116	16	1839	Because the mortality rate is so high , determining which factors are predictors is less important .
20196116	17	1938	A high proportion of patients had consumed ATT empirically , which could have been prevented .
2024540	0	0	Design and analysis of the HYPREN - trial : safety of enalapril and prazosin in the initial treatment phase of patients with congestive heart failure .
2024540	1	148	Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure , cases of severe hypotension , especially on the first day of treatment , have occasionally been reported .
2024540	2	398	To assess the safety of the ACE inhibitor enalapril a multicenter , randomized , prazosin - controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment .
2024540	3	615	Trial medication was 2 . 5 mg enalapril or 0 . 5 prazosin .
2024540	4	670	Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class II and III .
2024540	5	768	Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension ( 5 . 2 % ) than the patients who received prazosin ( 12 . 9 % ) .
2024540	6	940	All patients recovered .
2024540	7	964	It was concluded that treatment with enalapril was well tolerated and it is , therefore , unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with enalapril to inpatients .
20470218	0	0	Central nervous system complications during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a single pediatric institution .
20470218	1	121	Central nervous system ( CNS ) complications during treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) remain a challenging clinical problem .
20470218	2	268	Outcome improvement with more intensive chemotherapy has significantly increased the incidence and severity of adverse events .
20470218	3	395	This study analyzed the incidence of neurological complications during ALL treatment in a single pediatric institution , focusing on clinical , radiological , and electrophysiological findings .
20470218	4	586	Exclusion criteria included CNS leukemic infiltration at diagnosis , therapy - related peripheral neuropathy , late - onset encephalopathy , or long - term neurocognitive defects .
20470218	5	757	During a 9 - year period , we retrospectively collected 27 neurological events ( 11 % ) in as many patients , from 253 children enrolled in the ALL front - line protocol .
20470218	6	919	CNS complications included posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome ( n = 10 ) , stroke ( n = 5 ) , temporal lobe epilepsy ( n = 2 ) , high - dose methotrexate toxicity ( n = 2 ) , syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( n = 1 ) , and other unclassified events ( n = 7 ) .
20470218	7	1200	In conclusion , CNS complications are frequent events during ALL therapy , and require rapid detection and prompt treatment to limit permanent damage .
20477932	0	0	Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats : involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress , and prevention by topiramate .
20477932	1	146	Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced - behaviour is poorly understood .
20477932	2	360	Nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms .
20477932	3	529	Therefore NFkappaB activity , oxidative stress , neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS ) activity , spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate , a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction , were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats .
20477932	4	817	NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats , as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus , whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased .
20477932	5	1037	Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex .
20477932	6	1195	In contrast , learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase .
20477932	7	1337	These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine .
20477932	8	1488	Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed , showing novel neuroprotective properties .
20520283	0	0	Efficacy and safety of asenapine in a placebo - and haloperidol - controlled trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia .
20520283	1	134	Asenapine is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of schizophrenia or of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features .
20520283	2	341	In a double - blind 6 - week trial , 458 patients with acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to fixed - dose treatment with asenapine at 5 mg twice daily ( BID ) , asenapine at 10 mg BID , placebo , or haloperidol at 4 mg BID ( to verify assay sensitivity ) .
20520283	3	591	With last observations carried forward ( LOCF ) , mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score reductions from baseline to endpoint were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 mg BID ( - 16 . 2 ) and haloperidol ( - 15 . 4 ) than placebo ( - 10 . 7 ; both P < 0 . 05 ) ; using mixed model for repeated measures ( MMRM ) , changes at day 42 were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID ( - 21 . 3 and - 19 . 4 , respectively ) and haloperidol ( - 20 . 0 ) than placebo ( - 14 . 6 ; all P < 0 . 05 ) .
20520283	4	1071	On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale , all treatments were superior to placebo with LOCF and MMRM ; asenapine at 5 mg BID was superior to placebo on the negative subscale with MMRM and on the general psychopathology subscale with LOCF and MMRM .
20520283	5	1339	Treatment - related adverse events ( AEs ) occurred in 44 % and 52 % , 57 % , and 41 % of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID , haloperidol , and placebo groups , respectively .
20520283	6	1500	Extrapyramidal symptoms reported as AEs occurred in 15 % and 18 % , 34 % , and 10 % of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID , haloperidol , and placebo groups , respectively .
20520283	7	1662	Across all groups , no more than 5 % of patients had clinically significant weight change .
20520283	8	1751	Post hoc analyses indicated that efficacy was similar with asenapine and haloperidol ; greater contrasts were seen in AEs , especially extrapyramidal symptoms .
20528871	0	0	Salvage therapy with nelarabine , etoposide , and cyclophosphamide in relapsed / refractory paediatric T - cell lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphoma .
20528871	1	144	A combination of 5 d of nelarabine ( AraG ) with 5 d of etoposide ( VP ) and cyclophosphamide ( CPM ) and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was used as salvage therapy in seven children with refractory or relapsed T - cell leukaemia or lymphoma .
20528871	2	386	The most common side effects attributable to the AraG included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor neuropathy and musculoskeletal pain .
20528871	3	518	Haematological toxicity was greater for the combination than AraG alone , although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies .
20528871	4	693	All patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of AraG / VP / CPM .
20528871	5	840	Our experience supports the safety of giving AraG as salvage therapy in synchrony with etoposide and cyclophosphamide , although neurological toxicity must be closely monitored .
2054792	0	0	Effect of adriamycin combined with whole body hyperthermia on tumor and normal tissues .
2054792	1	88	Thermal enhancement of Adriamycin - mediated antitumor activity and normal tissue toxicities by whole body hyperthermia were compared using a F344 rat model .
2054792	2	244	Antitumor activity was studied using a tumor growth delay assay .
2054792	3	309	Acute normal tissue toxicities ( i . e . , leukopenia and thrombocytopenia ) and late normal tissue toxicities ( i . e . , myocardial and kidney injury ) were evaluated by functional / physiological assays and by morphological techniques .
2054792	4	534	Whole body hyperthermia ( 120 min at 41 . 5 degrees C ) enhanced both Adriamycin - mediated antitumor activity and toxic side effects .
2054792	5	663	The thermal enhancement ratio calculated for antitumor activity was 1 . 6 .
2054792	6	736	Thermal enhancement ratios estimated for " acute " hematological changes were 1 . 3 , whereas those estimated for " late " damage ( based on morphological cardiac and renal lesions ) varied between 2 . 4 and 4 . 3 .
2054792	7	938	Thus , while whole body hyperthermia enhances Adriamycin - mediated antitumor effect , normal tissue toxicity is also increased , and the potential therapeutic gain of the combined modality treatment is eroded .
20588063	0	0	Permeability , ultrastructural changes , and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis .
20588063	1	146	BACKGROUND / AIMS : It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria starts .
20588063	2	239	Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis ( PAN ) rats , we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte - associated molecules nephrin , a - actinin , dendrin , and plekhh2 , the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes .
20588063	3	526	METHODS : Using immune stainings , semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope .
20588063	4	633	Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers .
20588063	5	705	Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested .
20588063	6	753	RESULTS : By day 2 , some patchy foot process effacement , but no proteinuria , appeared .
20588063	7	839	The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas .
20588063	8	908	The other proteins showed few changes , which were limited to diseased areas .
20588063	9	985	By day 4 , foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage .
20588063	10	1104	Nephrin decreased further , while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a - actinin remained unchanged .
20588063	11	1206	ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect .
20588063	12	1259	CONCLUSIONS : PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4 , despite relatively mild proteinuria .
20588063	13	1370	This was preceded by altered nephrin expression , supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology .
20588063	14	1471	The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced , suggesting roles in PAN , whereas a - actinin was unchanged .
20619828	0	0	A novel , multiple symptom model of obsessive - compulsive - like behaviors in animals .
20619828	1	83	BACKGROUND : Current animal models of obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) typically involve acute , drug - induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety .
20619828	2	269	None of these current models demonstrate multiple OCD - like behaviors .
20619828	3	339	METHODS : Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood .
20619828	4	505	RESULTS : Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety ( elevated plus maze and marble burying ) , behavioral inflexibility ( perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning ) , working memory impairment ( e . g . , win - shift paradigm ) , hoarding , and corticostriatal dysfunction .
20619828	5	886	Dopamine D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum , whereas serotonin 2C , but not serotonin 1A , receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex .
20619828	6	1038	CONCLUSIONS : This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an OCD - like profile in animals .
20619828	7	1152	Moreover , these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to OCD .
20619828	8	1276	This novel model of OCD demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease - like systems permanently , which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders .
20621845	0	0	Elevation of ADAM10 , ADAM17 , MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 expression with media degeneration features CaCl2 - induced thoracic aortic aneurysm in a rat model .
20621845	1	144	PURPOSE : This study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm ( TAA ) by calcium chloride ( CaCl ( 2 ) ) - induced arterial injury and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase ( ADAM ) , matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and their endogenous inhibitors ( TIMPs ) in TAA formation .
20621845	2	462	METHODS : Thoracic aorta of male Sprague - Dawley rats was exposed to 0 . 5M CaCl ( 2 ) or normal saline ( NaCl ) .
20621845	3	567	After 12weeks , animals were euthanized , and CaCl ( 2 ) - treated , CaCl ( 2 ) - untreated ( n = 12 ) and NaCl - treated aortic segments ( n = 12 ) were collected for histological and molecular assessments .
20621845	4	752	MMP - TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi - quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry .
20621845	5	875	RESULTS : Despite similar external diameters among CaCl ( 2 ) - treated , non - CaCl ( 2 ) - treated and NaCl - treated segments , aneurymal alteration ( n = 6 , 50 % ) , media degeneration with regional disruption , fragmentation of elastic fiber , and increased collagen deposition ( n = 12 , 100 % ) were demonstrated in CaCl ( 2 ) - treated segments .
20621845	6	1193	MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl ( 2 ) - treated segments ( all p < 0 . 01 ) , with trends of elevation in CaCl ( 2 ) - untreated segments , as compared with NaCl - treated segments .
20621845	7	1392	Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 ( all p < 0 . 01 ) in intima and media for CaCl ( 2 ) - treated segments .
20621845	8	1559	TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments .
20621845	9	1645	CONCLUSION : This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl ( 2 ) exposure in rats , and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling .
20633755	0	0	Suxamethonium induced prolonged apnea in a patient receiving electroconvulsive therapy .
20633755	1	88	Suxamethonium causes prolonged apnea in patients in whom pseudocholinesterase enzyme gets deactivated by organophosphorus ( OP ) poisons .
20633755	2	224	Here , we present a similar incident in a severely depressed patient who received electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) .
20633755	3	338	Prolonged apnea in our case ensued because the information about suicidal attempt by OP compound was concealed from the treating team .
20667451	0	0	Curcumin ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damage in phenobarbitone and carbamazepine administered rats .
20667451	1	119	The antiepileptic drugs , phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are well known to cause cognitive impairment on chronic use .
20667451	2	238	The increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of cognitive impairment by antiepileptic drugs .
20667451	3	381	Curcumin has shown antioxidant , anti - inflammatory and neuro - protective properties .
20667451	4	464	Therefore , the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone - and carbamazepine - induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats .
20667451	5	666	Pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were also studied .
20667451	6	764	Vehicle / drugs were administered daily for 21days to male Wistar rats .
20667451	7	834	Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function .
20667451	8	929	At the end of study period , serum phenobarbitone and carbamazepine , whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated .
20667451	9	1072	The administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress .
20667451	10	1235	Concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs .
20667451	11	1389	Curcumin co - administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phenobarbitone as well as carbamazepine .
20667451	12	1534	These results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentrations .
20667451	13	1778	The findings suggest that curcumin can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to phenobarbitone and carbamazepine therapy in preventing cognitive impairment associated with these drugs .
20698227	0	0	Can angiogenesis be a target of treatment for ribavirin associated hemolytic anemia ?
20698227	1	85	BACKGROUND / AIMS : Recently ribavirin has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib have been found to cause acute hemolysis .
20698227	2	274	We aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin , haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against anemia .
20698227	3	466	METHODS : Fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin .
20698227	4	598	Serum hemoglobin , haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin - 2 were investigated before and after therapy .
20698227	5	753	RESULTS : We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period .
20698227	6	855	Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment .
20698227	7	922	In contrast with the literature , serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy .
20698227	8	1068	We found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin .
20698227	9	1163	CONCLUSION : This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis C and we could not find any relation .
20698227	10	1369	Future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of ribavirin therapy .
2070391	0	0	Reduction in injection pain using buffered lidocaine as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization .
2070391	1	107	Previous reports have suggested that pain associated with the injection of lidocaine is related to the acidic pH of the solution .
2070391	2	237	To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of lidocaine into the physiologic range would reduce pain during injection , we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization .
2070391	3	471	Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of pain after receiving standard lidocaine in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral area .
2070391	4	639	The mean pain score for buffered lidocaine was significantly lower than the mean score for standard lidocaine ( 2 . 7 + / - 1 . 9 vs . 3 . 8 + / - 2 . 2 , P = 0 . 03 ) .
2070391	5	790	The pH adjustment of standard lidocaine can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the pain occurring during the infiltration of tissues .
2071257	0	0	Effect of L - alpha - glyceryl - phosphorylcholine on amnesia caused by scopolamine .
2071257	1	79	The present study was carried out to test the effects of L - alpha - glycerylphosphorylcholine ( L - alpha - GFC ) on memory impairment induced by scopolamine in man .
2071257	2	236	Thirty - two healthy young volunteers were randomly allocated to four different groups .
2071257	3	322	They were given a ten day pretreatment with either L - alpha - GFC or placebo , p . o . , and on the eleventh day either scopolamine or placebo , i . m . Before and 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 h after injection the subjects were given attention and mnemonic tests .
2071257	4	566	The findings of this study indicate that the drug is able to antagonize impairment of attention and memory induced by scopolamine .

20880751	0	0	Levodopa - induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson ' s disease : filling the bench - to - bedside gap .
20880751	1	101	Levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson ' s disease .
20880751	2	179	However , the long - term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias .
20880751	3	298	Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa - induced dyskinesias , their pathogenesis is still unclear .
20880751	4	503	In recent years , evidence from animal models of Parkinson ' s disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post - receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of dyskinetic movements .
20880751	5	743	Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms , dopamine receptor subtypes , ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors , and non - dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of levodopa - induced dyskinesias .
20882060	0	0	Effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol - induced parkinsonian catalepsy : behavioral and electrophysiological studies .
20882060	1	124	OBJECTIVE : The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation .
20882060	2	201	Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum , and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects .
20882060	3	407	The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol - induced parkinsonian symptoms .
20882060	4	528	METHODS : Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study .
20882060	5	633	RESULTS : Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol - induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats .
20882060	6	763	Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration .
20882060	7	932	The neurotensin type - 1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin .
20882060	8	1072	CONCLUSION : Activation of pallidal neurotensin receptors may be involved in neurotensin - induced antiparkinsonian effects .
2096243	0	0	Carmofur - induced organic mental disorders .
2096243	1	43	Organic mental disorder was observed in a 29 - year - old female in the prognostic period after the onset of carmofur - induced leukoencephalopathy .
2096243	2	186	Symptoms such as euphoria , emotional lability and puerile attitude noted in the patient were diagnosed as organic personality syndrome according to the criteria defined in the DSM - III - R .
2096243	3	373	It is referred to as a frontal lobe syndrome .
2096243	4	419	Brain CT revealed a periventricular low density area in the frontal white matter and moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles especially at the bilateral anterior horns .
2096243	5	594	Consequently , carmofur - induced leukoencephalopathy may uncommonly result in organic personality syndrome in the residual state .
2096243	6	722	It may be attributed to the structural damage to the frontal lobe .
21029050	0	0	Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged apnea after succinylcholine for electroconvulsive therapy .
21029050	1	123	BACKGROUND : patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) often receive succinylcholine as part of the anesthetic procedure .
21029050	2	254	The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme ( BChE ) , the most common being the K - and the A - variants .
21029050	3	421	The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene ( BCHE ) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine after ECT .
21029050	4	627	METHODS : a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months .
21029050	5	744	We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods , the duration of apnea , time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used .
21029050	6	944	The duration of apnea was compared with published data on normal subjects .
21029050	7	1019	RESULTS : in 11 patients , mutations were found in the BCHE gene , the K - variant being the most frequent .
21029050	8	1122	The duration of apnea was 5 - 15 min compared with 3 - 5 . 3 min from the literature .
21029050	9	1202	Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients .
21029050	10	1267	Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients .
21029050	11	1318	CONCLUSION : eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in BCHE , indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea .
21029050	12	1507	We recommend objective neuromuscular monitoring during the first ECT .
220563	0	0	Perhexiline maleate and peripheral neuropathy .
220563	1	47	Peripheral neuropathy has been noted as a complication of therapy with perhexiline maleate , a drug widely used in France ( and in clinical trials in the United States ) for the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris .
220563	2	265	In 24 patients with this complication , the marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity and the electromyographic changes imply mainly a demyelinating disorder .
220563	3	431	Improvement was noted with cessation of therapy .
220563	4	480	In a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis , with only slight improvement .
220563	5	588	The underlying mechanism causing the neuropathy is not yet fully known , although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process .
2224762	0	0	A phase I study of 4 ' - 0 - tetrahydropyranyladriamycin .
2224762	1	53	Clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics .
2224762	2	97	A Phase I study of intravenous ( IV ) bolus 4 ' - 0 - tetrahydropyranyladriamycin ( Pirarubicin ) was done in 55 patients in good performance status with refractory tumors .
2224762	3	261	Twenty - six had minimal prior therapy ( good risk ) , 23 had extensive prior therapy ( poor risk ) , and six had renal and / or hepatic dysfunction .
2224762	4	401	A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg / m2 were evaluable .
2224762	5	467	Maximum tolerated dose in good - risk patients was 70 mg / m2 , and in poor - risk patients , 60 mg / m2 .
2224762	6	563	The dose - limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative granulocytopenia .
2224762	7	640	Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 ( range , 4 - 22 ) .
2224762	8	687	Less frequent toxic effects included thrombocytopenia , anemia , nausea , mild alopecia , phlebitis , and mucositis .
2224762	9	799	Myelosuppression was more in patients with hepatic dysfunction .
2224762	10	863	Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed Pirarubicin plasma T 1 / 2 alpha ( + / - SE ) of 2 . 5 + / - 0 . 85 minutes , T beta 1 / 2 of 25 . 6 + / - 6 . 5 minutes , and T 1 / 2 gamma of 23 . 6 + / - 7 . 6 hours .
2224762	11	1052	The area under the curve was 537 + / - 149 ng / ml x hours , volume of distribution ( Vd ) 3504 + / - 644 l / m2 , and total clearance ( ClT ) was 204 + 39 . 3 l / hour / m2 .
2224762	12	1207	Adriamycinol , doxorubicin , adriamycinone , and tetrahydropyranyladriamycinol were the metabolites detected in plasma and the amount of doxorubicin was less than or equal to 10 % of the total metabolites .
2224762	13	1409	Urinary excretion of Pirarubicin in the first 24 hours was less than or equal to 10 % .
2224762	14	1495	Activity was noted in mesothelioma , leiomyosarcoma , and basal cell carcinoma .
2224762	15	1573	The recommended starting dose for Phase II trials is 60 mg / m2 IV bolus every 3 weeks .
2234245	0	0	Ocular and auditory toxicity in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine .
2234245	1	81	During an 18 - month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine ( 10 - 40 mg / kg BW / 3 times weekly ) for the first time were monitored for detection of audiovisual toxicity . 6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity .
2234245	2	343	Moreover , detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients .
2234245	3	457	Visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan - type dyschromatopsy , sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pigmentary retinal deposits .
2234245	4	633	Auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid - to high - frequency neurosensorial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear type .
2234245	5	766	Desferrioxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3 , and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3 .
2234245	6	965	This toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of desferrioxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum levels .
2234245	7	1121	The data indicate that audiovisual toxicity is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine .
2234245	8	1251	Periodical audiovisual monitoring should be performed on hemodialyzed patients receiving the drug in order to detect adverse effects as early as possible .
2265898	0	0	Serial epilepsy caused by levodopa / carbidopa administration in two patients on hemodialysis .
2265898	1	93	Two patients with similar clinical features are presented : both patients had chronic renal failure , on hemodialysis for many years but recently begun on a high - flux dialyzer ; both had been receiving a carbidopa / levodopa preparation ; and both had the onset of hallucinosis and recurrent seizures , which were refractory to anticonvulsants .
2265898	2	431	The first patient died without a diagnosis ; the second patient had a dramatic recovery following the administration of vitamin B6 .
2265898	3	562	Neither patient was considered to have a renal state sufficiently severe enough to explain their presentation .
2266990	0	0	Randomized , double - blind trial of mazindol in Duchenne dystrophy .
2266990	1	66	There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy .
2266990	2	173	We conducted a 12 - month controlled trial of mazindol , a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor , in 83 boys with Duchenne dystrophy .
2266990	3	310	Muscle strength , contractures , functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline , and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol ( 3 mg / d ) or placebo .
2266990	4	479	The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0 . 90 to detect a slowing to 25 % of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0 . 05 .
2266990	5	635	Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study .
2266990	6	696	Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite ( 36 % ) , dry mouth ( 10 % ) , behavioral change ( 22 % ) , and gastrointestinal symptoms ( 18 % ) ; mazindol dosage was reduced in 43 % of patients .
2266990	7	896	The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF - I levels obtained following 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups .
2266990	8	1103	Although mazindol - treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo - treated patients , no significant effect on IGF - I levels was observed .
2266990	9	1251	Mazindol doses not slow the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy .
2273650	0	0	Facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test morphine and its state dependency in the step - through type passive avoidance learning test in mice .
2273650	1	145	Amnesia produced by scopolamine and cycloheximide were reversed by morphine given 30 min before the test trial ( pre - test ) , and pre - test morphine also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered naloxone during the training trial .
2273650	2	392	Similarly , pre - test scopolamine partially reversed the scopolamine - induced amnesia , but not significantly ; and pre - test cycloheximide failed to reverse the cycloheximide - induced amnesia .
2273650	3	579	These results suggest that the facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test morphine might be the direct action of morphine rather than a state dependent effect .
227508	0	0	Naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine .
227508	1	60	In unanesthetized , spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine , 5 to 20 micrograms / kg , was inhibited or reversed by nalozone , 0 . 2 to 2 mg / kg .
227508	2	270	The hypotensive effect of 100 mg / kg alpha - methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone .
227508	3	364	Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate .
227508	4	431	In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 5 ) M , did not influence stereoselective binding of [ 3H ] - naloxone ( 8 nM ) , and naloxone , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 4 ) M , did not influence clonidine - suppressible binding of [ 3H ] - dihydroergocryptine ( 1 nM ) .
227508	5	704	These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha - adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors .
227508	6	862	As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site , the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha - methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone .
230316	0	0	Neurotoxicity of halogenated hydroxyquinolines : clinical analysis of cases reported outside Japan .
230316	1	99	An analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated hydroxyquinolines reported from outside Japan .
230316	2	232	In 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of clioquinol could be excluded .
230316	3	384	Of the remainder , a relationship to clioquinol was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases .
230316	4	487	In six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of clioquinol over a short period .
230316	5	676	The most common manifestation , observed in 15 further cases , was isolated optic atrophy .
230316	6	765	This was most frequently found in children , many of whom had received clioquinol as treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica .
230316	7	893	In the remaining cases , a combination of myelopathy , visual disturbance , and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifestation .
230316	8	1027	Isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy , or these manifestations occurring together , were infrequent .
230316	9	1134	The onset of all manifestations ( except toxic encephalopathy ) was usually subacute , with subsequent partial recovery .
230316	10	1252	Older subjects tended to display more side effects .
230316	11	1304	The full syndrome of subacute myelo - optic neuropathy was more frequent in women , but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug .
2304736	0	0	Prazosin - induced stress incontinence .
2304736	1	38	A case of genuine stress incontinence due to prazosin , a common antihypertensive drug , is presented .
2304736	2	139	Prazosin exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha - 1 adrenergic receptors .
2304736	3	282	As an alpha - blocker , it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra .
2304736	4	381	The patient ' s clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on prazosin and subsequent studies while taking verapamil .
2304736	5	536	Her incontinence resolved with the change of medication .
2304736	6	593	The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure , maximum urethral closure pressure , and functional urethral length .
2304736	7	758	Patients who present with stress incontinence while taking prazosin should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery , because their incontinence may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy .
2312209	0	0	Myocardial infarction following sublingual administration of isosorbide dinitrate .
2312209	1	83	A 78 - year - old with healed septal necrosis suffered a recurrent myocardial infarction of the anterior wall following the administration of isosorbide dinitrate 5 mg sublingually .
2312209	2	261	After detailing the course of events , we discuss the role of paradoxical coronary spasm and hypotension - mediated myocardial ischemia occurring downstream to significant coronary arterial stenosis in the pathophysiology of acute coronary insufficiency .
2334618	0	0	Comparison of the respiratory effects of i . v . infusions of morphine and regional analgesia by extradural block .
2334618	1	112	The incidence of postoperative respiratory apnoea was compared between five patients receiving a continuous i . v . infusion of morphine ( mean 73 . 6 mg ) and five patients receiving a continuous extradural infusion of 0 . 25 % bupivacaine ( mean 192 mg ) in the 24 - h period following upper abdominal surgery .
2334618	2	411	Monitoring consisted of airflow detection by a carbon dioxide analyser , chest wall movement detected by pneumatic capsules , and continuous electrocardiograph recorded with a Holter ambulatory monitor .
2334618	3	612	Both obstructive ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and central apnoea ( P less than 0 . 05 ) occurred more frequently in patients who had a morphine infusion .
2334618	4	752	There was also a higher incidence of tachyarrhythmias ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and ventricular ectopic beats ( P less than 0 . 05 ) in the morphine infusion group .
234669	0	0	Effects of aminophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular fibrillation during respiratory failure .
234669	1	110	Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure .
234669	2	201	The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized .
234669	3	362	The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid - base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs .
234669	4	545	The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle .
234669	5	738	During the infusion of aminophylline , the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen ( PO2 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) were kept within normal limits .
234669	6	965	When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation ( pH 7 . 05 to 7 . 25 ; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg : P02 20 to 40 mm Hg ) , infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level .
234669	7	1220	These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure , pharmacologic agents , particularly aminophylline , may play a significant role .
2348231	0	0	Pentoxifylline ( Trental ) does not inhibit dipyridamole - induced coronary hyperemia : implications for dipyridamole - thallium - 201 myocardial imaging .
2348231	1	146	Dipyridamole - thallium - 201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular disease .
2348231	2	270	Many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline ( Trental ) , a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent claudication .
2348231	3	403	Whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole - induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole - thallium - 201 imaging is unknown .
2348231	4	600	Therefore , we studied the hyperemic response to dipyridamole in seven open - chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline ( 0 , 7 . 5 , or 15 mg / kg i . v . ) or theophylline ( 3 mg / kg i . v . ) .
2348231	5	804	Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups .
2348231	6	898	Dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7 . 5 or 15 mm / kg i . v . pentoxifylline ( p less than 0 . 002 ) .
2348231	7	1029	Neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole - induced hyperemia , while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline ( p less than 0 . 01 ) .
2348231	8	1214	We conclude that pentoxyifylline does not inhibit dipyridamole - induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses .
2355241	0	0	Cause of death among patients with Parkinson ' s disease : a rare mortality due to cerebral haemorrhage .
2355241	1	102	Causes of death , with special reference to cerebral haemorrhage , among 240 patients with pathologically verified Parkinson ' s disease were investigated using the Annuals of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1981 to 1985 .
2355241	2	333	The leading causes of death were pneumonia and bronchitis ( 44 . 1 % ) , malignant neoplasms ( 11 . 6 % ) , heart diseases ( 4 . 1 % ) , cerebral infarction ( 3 . 7 % ) and septicaemia ( 3 . 3 % ) .
2355241	3	503	Cerebral haemorrhage was the 11th most frequent cause of death , accounting for only 0 . 8 % of deaths among the patients , whereas it was the 5th most common cause of death among the Japanese general population in 1985 .
2355241	4	719	The low incidence of cerebral haemorrhage as a cause of death in patients with Parkinson ' s disease may reflect the hypotensive effect of levodopa and a hypotensive mechanism due to reduced noradrenaline levels in the parkinsonian brain .
2375138	0	0	Possible intramuscular midazolam - associated cardiorespiratory arrest and death .
2375138	1	80	Midazolam hydrochloride is commonly used for dental or endoscopic procedures .
2375138	2	158	Although generally consisted safe when given intramuscularly , intravenous administration is known to cause respiratory and cardiovascular depression .
2375138	3	308	This report describes the first published case of cardiorespiratory arrest and death associated with intramuscular administration of midazolam .
2375138	4	452	Information regarding midazolam use is reviewed to provide recommendation for safe administration .
2385256	0	0	Myasthenia gravis presenting as weakness after magnesium administration .
2385256	1	73	We studied a patient with no prior history of neuromuscular disease who became virtually quadriplegic after parenteral magnesium administration for preeclampsia .
2385256	2	235	The serum magnesium concentration was 3 . 0 mEq / L , which is usually well tolerated .
2385256	3	317	The magnesium was stopped and she recovered over a few days .
2385256	4	378	While she was weak , 2 - Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise , suggesting postsynaptic neuromuscular blockade .
2385256	5	562	After her strength returned , repetitive stimulation was normal , but single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking .
2385256	6	687	Her acetylcholine receptor antibody level was markedly elevated .
2385256	7	752	Although paralysis after magnesium administration has been described in patients with known myasthenia gravis , it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease .
2385256	8	955	Patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of magnesium should be suspected of having an underlying disorder of neuromuscular transmission .
2396046	0	0	No enhancement by phenobarbital of the hepatocarcinogenicity of a choline - devoid diet in the rat .
2396046	1	98	An experiment was performed to test whether inclusion of phenobarbital in a choline - devoid diet would increase the hepatocarcinogenicity of the diet .
2396046	2	248	Groups of 5 - week old male Fischer - 344 rats were fed for 7 - 25 months semipurified choline - devoid or choline - supplemented diets , containing or not 0 . 06 % phenobarbital .
2396046	3	414	No hepatic preneoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas developed in rats fed the plain choline - supplemented diet , while one preneoplastic nodule and one hepatocellular carcinoma developed in two rats fed the same diet containing phenobarbital .
2396046	4	665	The incidence of preneoplastic nodules and of hepatocellular carcinomas was 10 % and 37 % , respectively , in rats fed the plain choline - devoid diet , and 17 % and 30 % , in rats fed the phenobarbital - containing choline - devoid diet .
2396046	5	890	The results evinced no enhancement of the hepatocarcinogenicity of the choline - devoid diet by phenobarbital .
2396046	6	999	Sporadic neoplastic lesions were observed in organs other than the liver of some of the animals , irrespective of the diet fed .
2425813	0	0	On two paradoxical side - effects of prednisolone in rats , ribosomal RNA biosyntheses , and a mechanism of action .
2425813	1	112	Liver enlargement and muscle wastage occurred in Wistar rats following the subcutaneous administration of prednisolone .
2425813	2	232	In the liver both the content of RNA and the biosynthesis of ribosomal RNA increased while both the RNA content and ribosomal RNA biosynthesis were reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle .
2425813	3	417	It is suggested that the drug acted in a selective and tissue - specific manner to enhance ribosomal RNA synthesis in the liver and depress such synthesis in the muscle .
2425813	4	585	This view supports the contention that the liver and muscle are independent sites of prednisolone action .
2440413	0	0	Differential effects of gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane ( lindane ) on pharmacologically - induced seizures .
2440413	1	101	Gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane ( gamma - HCH ) , the active ingredient of the insecticide lindane , has been shown to decrease seizure threshold to pentylenetrazol ( PTZ ) 3 h after exposure to gamma - HCH and conversely increase threshold to PTZ - induced seizures 24 h after exposure to gamma - HCH ( Vohland et al . 1981 ) .
2440413	2	408	In this study , the severity of response to other seizure - inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg / kg gamma - HCH .
2440413	3	571	One hour after the administration of gamma - HCH , the activity of seizure - inducing agents was increased , regardless of their mechanism , while 24 h after gamma - HCH a differential response was observed .
2440413	4	770	Seizure activity due to PTZ and picrotoxin ( PTX ) was significantly decreased ; however , seizure activity due to 3 - mercaptopropionic acid ( MPA ) , bicuculline ( BCC ) , methyl 6 , 7 - dimethoxy - 4 - ethyl - B - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ( DMCM ) , or strychnine ( STR ) was not different from control .
2440413	5	1047	In vitro , gamma - HCH , pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin were shown to inhibit 3H - TBOB binding in mouse whole brain , with IC50 values of 4 . 6 , 404 and 9 . 4 microM , respectively .
2440413	6	1220	MPA , BCC , DMCM , and STR showed no inhibition of 3H - TBOB ( t - butyl bicyclo - orthobenzoate ) binding at concentrations of 100 micron .
2440413	7	1349	The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to seizure activity induced by PTZ and PTX 24 h after gamma - HCH , since the response to only these two seizure - inducing agents is decreased .
2440413	8	1557	The in vitro data suggest that the site responsible for the decrease in seizure activity 24 h after gamma - HCH may be the GABA - A receptor - linked chloride channel .
2445283	0	0	Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin in patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever .
2445283	1	90	Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin was studied in 6 patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever ( AHF ) of more than 8 days of evolution .
2445283	2	233	Administration of ribavirin resulted in a neutralization of viremia and a drop of endogenous interferon titers .
2445283	3	345	The average time of death was delayed .
2445283	4	384	A reversible anemia was the only adverse effect observed .
2445283	5	442	From these results , we conclude that ribavirin has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of AHF , and that anemia , the only secondary reaction observed , can be easily managed .
2445283	6	617	The possible beneficial effect of ribavirin during the initial days of AHF is discussed .
2476560	0	0	Is the treatment of scabies hazardous ?
2476560	1	39	Treatment for scabies is usually initiated by general practitioners ; most consider lindane ( gamma benzene hexachloride ) the treatment of choice .
2476560	2	184	Lindane is also widely used as an agricultural and industrial pesticide , and as a result the toxic profile of this insecticide is well understood .
2476560	3	331	Evidence is accumulating that lindane can be toxic to the central nervous system and may be associated with aplastic anaemia .
2476560	4	457	Preparations containing lindane continue to be sold over the counter and may represent a hazard to poorly informed patients .
2476560	5	582	This literature review suggests that general practitioners should prescribe scabicides with increased caution for certain at - risk groups , and give adequate warnings regarding potential toxicity .
2484011	0	0	Mouse strain - dependent effect of amantadine on motility and brain biogenic amines .
2484011	1	83	The effect of amantadine hydrochloride , injected i . p . in 6 increments of 100 mg / kg each over 30 hr , on mouse motility and whole brain content of selected biogenic amines and major metabolites was studied in 4 strains of mice .
2484011	2	309	These were the albino Sprague - Dawley ICR and BALB / C , the black C57BL / 6 and the brown CDF - I mouse strains .
2484011	3	415	Amantadine treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse motility .
2484011	4	482	The initial dose of amantadine depressed locomotor activity in all mouse strains studied with the BALB / C mice being the most sensitive .
2484011	5	618	Subsequent amantadine treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the BALB / C mice being the least sensitive .
2484011	6	780	The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied , except for the ICR mice , during an overnight drug - free period following the fourth amantadine treatment .
2484011	7	974	Readministration of amantadine , after a drug - free overnight period , increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB / C mice where suppression of motility occurred .
2484011	8	1181	Treatment with amantadine did not alter whole brain dopamine levels but decreased the amounts of 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the BALB / C mice compared to saline control .
2484011	9	1356	Conversely , brain normetanephrine concentration was increased from saline control by amantadine in the BALB / C mice .
2484011	10	1472	The results suggest a strain - dependent effect of amantadine on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used .
2484011	11	1627	The BALB / C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of amantadine .
2484011	12	1761	The biochemical results of brain biogenic amines of BALB / C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of catecholamine turnover rate and / or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in O - methylation of norepinephrine which may account for a behavioral depression caused by amantadine in the BALB / C mice .
2505783	0	0	Chloroacetaldehyde and its contribution to urotoxicity during treatment with cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide .
2505783	1	109	An experimental study / short communication .
2505783	2	152	Based on clinical data , indicating that chloroacetaldehyde ( CAA ) is an important metabolite of oxazaphosphorine cytostatics , an experimental study was carried out in order to elucidate the role of CAA in the development of hemorrhagic cystitis .
2505783	3	397	The data demonstrate that CAA after i . v . administration does not contribute to bladder damage .
2505783	4	492	When instilled directly into the bladder , CAA exerts urotoxic effects , it is , however , susceptible to detoxification with mesna .
2515254	0	0	Source of pain and primitive dysfunction in migraine : an identical site ?
2515254	1	73	Twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin ( 10 patients ) or placebo ointment ( 10 patients ) in a double blind study .
2515254	2	243	Early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group .
2515254	3	370	Subsequently 20 migraine patients , who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin , received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas .
2515254	4	542	No early onset migraine was observed .
2515254	5	580	Thus the migraine - inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain , suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine crisis .
2515254	6	807	This is not consistent with a CNS origin of migraine attack .
2522601	0	0	Hypersensitivity to carbamazepine presenting with a leukemoid reaction , eosinophilia , erythroderma , and renal failure .
2522601	1	119	We report a patient in whom hypersensitivity to carbamazepine presented with generalized erythroderma , a severe leukemoid reaction , eosinophilia , hyponatremia , and renal failure .
2522601	2	298	This is the first report of such an unusual reaction to carbamazepine .
2549018	0	0	Fluoxetine - induced akathisia : clinical and theoretical implications .
2549018	1	69	Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia .
2549018	2	196	The typical fluoxetine - induced symptoms of restlessness , constant pacing , purposeless movements of the feet and legs , and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic - induced akathisia .
2549018	3	401	Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic - induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine - induced akathisia were identical , although somewhat milder .
2549018	4	579	Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta - adrenergic antagonist propranolol , dose reduction , or both .
2549018	5	755	The authors suggest that fluoxetine - induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine - induced akathisia and tricyclic antidepressant - induced " jitteriness " may be identical .
2559236	0	0	Effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the course of adriamycin - induced nephropathy .
2559236	1	88	The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor ( CEI ) enalapril was assessed in Munich - Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis .
2559236	2	224	Rats were given a single dose of adriamycin and one month later divided into four groups matched for albuminuria , blood pressure , and plasma albumin concentration .
2559236	3	388	Groups 1 and 3 remained untreated while groups 2 and 4 received enalapril .
2559236	4	463	Groups 1 and 2 underwent micropuncture studies after 10 days .
2559236	5	525	These short - term studies showed that enalapril reduced arterial blood pressure ( 101 + / - 2 vs . 124 + / - 3 mm Hg , group 2 vs . 1 , P less than 0 . 05 ) and glomerular capillary pressure ( 54 + / - 1 vs . 61 + / - 2 mm Hg , P less than 0 . 05 ) without reducing albuminuria ( 617 + / - 50 vs . 570 + / - 47 mg / day ) or GFR ( 1 . 03 + / - 0 . 04 vs . 1 . 04 + / - 0 . 11 ml / min ) .
2559236	6	864	Groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of enalapril on progression of renal injury in adriamycin nephrosis .
2559236	7	1008	Chronic enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing albuminuria in group 4 .
2559236	8	1100	Untreated group 3 rats exhibited a progressive reduction in GFR ( 0 . 35 + / - 0 . 08 ml / min at 4 months , 0 . 27 + / - 0 . 07 ml / min at 6 months ) .
2559236	9	1234	Enalapril treatment blunted but did not prevent reduction in GFR in group 4 ( 0 . 86 + / - 0 . 15 ml / min at 4 months , 0 . 69 + / - 0 . 13 ml / min at 6 months , both P less than 0 . 05 vs . group 3 ) .
2559236	10	1415	Reduction in GFR was associated with the development of glomerular sclerosis in both treated and untreated rats . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
2572625	0	0	Clotiazepam - induced acute hepatitis .
2572625	1	37	We report the case of a patient who developed acute hepatitis with extensive hepatocellular necrosis , 7 months after the onset of administration of clotiazepam , a thienodiazepine derivative .
2572625	2	228	Clotiazepam withdrawal was followed by prompt recovery .
2572625	3	284	The administration of several benzodiazepines , chemically related to clotiazepam , did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of hepatitis .
2572625	4	443	This observation shows that clotiazepam can induce acute hepatitis and suggests that there is no cross hepatotoxicity between clotiazepam and several benzodiazepines .
2578334	0	0	5 - azacytidine potentiates initiation induced by carcinogens in rat liver .
2578334	1	74	To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process , 5 - azacytidine ( 5 - AzC ) ( 10 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of DNA methylation , was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens , benzo [ a ] - pyrene ( 200 mg / kg ) , N - methyl - N - nitrosourea ( 60 mg / kg ) and 1 , 2 - dimethylhydrazine ( 1 , 2 - DMH ) ( 100 mg / kg ) .
2578334	2	476	The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma - glutamyltransferase ( gamma - GT ) positive foci formed following a 2 - week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0 . 02 % 2 - acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4 .
2578334	3	720	The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens , administration of 5 - AzC during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes , for example 10 - 20 foci / cm2 in 5 - AzC and carcinogen - treated rats compared with 3 - 5 foci / cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only .
2578334	4	1010	Administration of [ 3H ] - 5 - azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1 , 2 - DMH further showed that 0 . 019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue , indicating that incorporation of 5 - AzC occurs during repair synthesis .
2578334	5	1264	In the absence of the carcinogen , 5 - AzC given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy , when its incorporation should be maximum , failed to induce any gamma - GT positive foci .
2578334	6	1437	The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation .
2578334	7	1530	Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation , the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA .
26094	0	0	Antihypertensive drugs and depression : a reappraisal .
26094	1	54	Eighty - nine new referral hypertensive out - patients and 46 new referral non - hypertensive chronically physically ill out - patients completed a mood rating scale at regular intervals for one year .
26094	2	247	The results showed a high prevalence of depression in both groups of patients , with no preponderance in the hypertensive group .
26094	3	375	Hypertensive patients with psychiatric histories had a higher prevalence of depression than the comparison patients .
26094	4	492	This was accounted for by a significant number of depressions occurring in methyl dopa treated patients with psychiatric histories .
2611118	0	0	Chronic active hepatitis associated with diclofenac sodium therapy .
2611118	1	68	Diclofenac sodium ( Voltarol , Geigy Pharmaceuticals ) is a non - steroidal anti - inflammatory derivative of phenylacetic acid .
2611118	2	190	Although generally well - tolerated , asymptomatic abnormalities of liver function have been recorded and , less commonly , severe hepatitis induced by diclofenac .
2611118	3	349	The patient described developed chronic active hepatitis after six months therapy with diclofenac sodium which progressed despite the withdrawal of the drug , a finding not previously reported .
2632720	0	0	Arterial hypertension as a complication of prolonged ketoconazole treatment .
2632720	1	77	Two of 14 patients with Cushing ' s syndrome treated on a long - term basis with ketoconazole developed sustained hypertension .
2632720	2	201	In both cases normal plasma and urinary free cortisol levels had been achieved following ketoconazole therapy , yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension 31 ( patient 1 ) and 52 weeks ( patient 2 ) after treatment .
2632720	3	436	In patient 1 , plasma levels of deoxycorticosterone and 11 - deoxycortisol were elevated .
2632720	4	523	In patient 2 , in addition to an increase in both deoxycorticosterone and 11 - deoxycortisol levels , plasma aldosterone values were raised , with a concomitant suppression of renin levels .
2632720	5	708	Our findings show that long - term treatment with high doses of ketoconazole may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid - related hypertension .
2670794	0	0	Effects of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( Captopril ) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular coagulation in the rat .
2670794	1	151	Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid ( AMCA ) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man .
2670794	2	389	Injection of Captopril ( 1 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) , reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model .
2670794	3	542	The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme - blocking agent .
2670794	4	634	The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed , indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein .
2670794	5	763	Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril .
2670794	6	867	The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone .
2670794	7	987	It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin ) .
2670794	8	1228	Captopril may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli , with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced .
2673163	0	0	Stroke associated with cocaine use .
2673163	1	36	We describe eight patients in whom cocaine use was related to stroke and review 39 cases from the literature .
2673163	2	146	Among these 47 patients the mean ( + / - SD ) age was 32 . 5 + / - 12 . 1 years ; 76 % ( 34 / 45 ) were men .
2673163	3	239	Stroke followed cocaine use by inhalation , intranasal , intravenous , and intramuscular routes .
2673163	4	333	Intracranial aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations were present in 17 of 32 patients studied angiographically or at autopsy ; cerebral vasculitis was present in two patients .
2673163	5	510	Cerebral infarction occurred in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , intracerebral hemorrhage in 22 ( 49 % ) , and subarachnoid hemorrhage in 13 ( 29 % ) .
2673163	6	640	These data indicate that ( 1 ) the apparent incidence of stroke related to cocaine use is increasing ; ( 2 ) cocaine - associated stroke occurs primarily in young adults ; ( 3 ) stroke may follow any route of cocaine administration ; ( 4 ) stroke after cocaine use is frequently associated with intracranial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations ; and ( 5 ) in cocaine - associated stroke , the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage exceeds that of cerebral infarction .
2696505	0	0	A randomized comparison of labetalol and nitroprusside for induced hypotension .
2696505	1	80	In a randomized study , labetalol - induced hypotension and nitroprusside - induced hypotension were compared in 20 patients ( 10 in each group ) scheduled for major orthopedic procedures .
2696505	2	262	Each patient was subjected to an identical anesthetic protocol and similar drug - induced reductions in mean arterial blood pressure ( BP ) ( 50 to 55 mmHg ) .
2696505	3	415	Nitroprusside infusion was associated with a significant ( p less than 0 . 05 ) increase in heart rate and cardiac output ; rebound hypertension was observed in three patients after discontinuation of nitroprusside .
2696505	4	626	Labetalol administration was not associated with any of these findings .
2696505	5	698	Arterial PO2 decreased in both groups .
2696505	6	737	It was concluded that labetalol offers advantages over nitroprusside .
2802551	0	0	Sodium status influences chronic amphotericin B nephrotoxicity in rats .
2802551	1	72	The nephrotoxic potential of amphotericin B ( 5 mg / kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks ) has been investigated in salt - depleted , normal - salt , and salt - loaded rats .
2802551	2	239	In salt - depleted rats , amphotericin B decreased creatinine clearance linearly with time , with an 85 % reduction by week 3 .
2802551	3	361	In contrast , in normal - salt rats creatinine clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3 , and in salt - loaded rats creatinine clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43 % at week 3 .
2802551	4	577	All rats in the sodium - depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal - salt or salt - loaded rat .
2802551	5	761	Concentrations of amphotericin B in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study .
2802551	6	890	However , at the end of 3 weeks , amphotericin B levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt - depleted and normal - salt rats than those in salt - loaded rats , with plasma / kidney ratios of 21 , 14 , and 8 in salt - depleted , normal - salt , and salt - loaded rats , respectively .
2802551	7	1175	In conclusion , reductions in creatinine clearance and renal amphotericin B accumulation after chronic amphotericin B administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by sodium loading in rats .
2870085	0	0	Flestolol : an ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent .
2870085	1	65	Flestolol ( ACC - 9089 ) is a nonselective , competitive , ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent , without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity .
2870085	2	217	Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half - life of approximately 6 . 5 minutes .
2870085	3	325	This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms / kg / min .
2870085	4	415	In long - term infusion studies , flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta - blocking dose ( 5 micrograms / kg / min ) for up to seven days .
2870085	5	555	Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta - adrenergic blockade .
2870085	6	726	Flestolol produced a dose - dependent attenuation of isoproterenol - induced tachycardia .
2870085	7	812	Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers .
2870085	8	913	In contrast with other beta blockers , flestolol - induced effects reverse rapidly ( within 30 minutes ) following discontinuation because of its short half - life .
2870085	9	1071	Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia .
2870085	10	1163	In patients with unstable angina , flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain .
2870085	11	1278	It is concluded that flestolol is a potent , well - tolerated , ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent .
2870085	12	1389	Use of flestolol in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation .
2887062	0	0	Immunohistochemical , electron microscopic and morphometric studies of estrogen - induced rat prolactinomas after bromocriptine treatment .
2887062	1	136	To clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactinoma cells in vivo , immunohistochemical , ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to estrogen - induced rat prolactinoma cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of bromocriptine ( 3 mg / kg of body weight ) .
2887062	2	399	One h after treatment , serum prolactin levels decreased markedly .
2887062	3	465	Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules , slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum , and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the prolactinoma cells .
2887062	4	633	Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased , while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased .
2887062	5	785	These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules .
2887062	6	996	At 6 h after injection , serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls .
2887062	7	1091	The prolactinoma cells at this time were well granulated , with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae .
2887062	8	1232	Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules , Golgi cisternae , and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactinoma cells .
2887062	9	1429	However , only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells .
2887062	10	1570	An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis , suggesting that bromocriptine inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion .
2894766	0	0	Sulfasalazine - induced lupus erythematosus .
2894766	1	43	Pneumonitis , bilateral pleural effusions , echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade , and positive autoantibodies developed in a 43 - year - old man , who was receiving long - term sulfasalazine therapy for chronic ulcerative colitis .
2894766	2	276	After cessation of the sulfasalazine and completion of a six - week course of corticosteroids , these problems resolved over a period of four to six months .
2894766	3	430	It is suggested that the patient had sulfasalazine - induced lupus , which manifested with serositis and pulmonary parenchymal involvement in the absence of joint symptoms .
2894766	4	600	Physicians who use sulfasalazine to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease should be aware of the signs of sulfasalazine - induced lupus syndrome .
2924746	0	0	Chronic carbamazepine treatment in the rat : efficacy , toxicity , and effect on plasma and tissue folate concentrations .
2924746	1	119	Folate depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug ( AED ) therapy .
2924746	2	206	Carbamazepine ( CBZ ) , a commonly used AED , has been implicated in some clinical studies .
2924746	3	294	A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic CBZ treatment on folate concentrations in the rat .
2924746	4	405	In the course of developing this model , a common vehicle , propylene glycol , by itself in high doses , was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain .
2924746	5	601	Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether ( HFDE ) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by CBZ than seizures induced by maximal electroshock ( MES ) .
2924746	6	773	Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg / kg was continuously protective against HFDE - induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment .
2924746	7	994	The CBZ levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals , however , were below those normally considered protective .
2924746	8	1114	This treatment with CBZ had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat , and , indeed , the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment .
2950248	0	0	Dipyridamole - induced myocardial ischemia .
2950248	1	42	Angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral dipyridamole in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization procedures .
2950248	2	216	To our knowledge , this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative dipyridamole therapy , although dipyridamole - induced myocardial ischemia has been demonstrated to occur in animals and humans with coronary artery disease .
2950248	3	460	Epicardial coronary collateral vessels were demonstrated in all four patients ; a coronary " steal " phenomenon may be the mechanism of the dipyridamole - induced ischemia observed .
2951327	0	0	Inhibition of sympathoadrenal activity by atrial natriuretic factor in dogs .
2951327	1	77	In six conscious , trained dogs , maintained on a normal sodium intake of 2 to 4 mEq / kg / day , sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of norepinephrine and epinephrine during 15 - minute i . v . infusions of human alpha - atrial natriuretic factor .
2951327	2	330	Mean arterial pressure ( as a percentage of control + / - SEM ) during randomized infusions of 0 . 03 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 3 , or 1 . 0 microgram / kg / min was 99 + / - 1 , 95 + / - 1 ( p less than 0 . 05 ) , 93 + / - 1 ( p less than 0 . 01 ) , or 79 + / - 6 % ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , respectively , but no tachycardia and no augmentation of the norepinephrine release rate ( up to 0 . 3 microgram / kg / min ) were observed , which is in contrast to comparable hypotension induced by hydralazine or nitroglycerin .
2951327	3	787	The release rate of epinephrine ( control , 6 . 7 + / - 0 . 6 ng / kg / min ) declined immediately during infusions of atrial natriuretic factor to a minimum of 49 + / - 5 % of control ( p less than 0 . 001 ) during 0 . 1 microgram / kg / min and to 63 + / - 5 % ( 0 . 1 greater than p greater than 0 . 05 ) or 95 + / - 13 % ( not significant ) during 0 . 3 or 1 . 0 microgram / kg / min .
2951327	4	1128	Steady state arterial plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were 39 + / - 10 pg / ml ( n = 6 ) during infusions of saline and 284 + / - 24 pg / ml ( n = 6 ) and 1520 + / - 300 pg / ml ( n = 9 ) during 0 . 03 and 0 . 1 microgram / kg / min infusions of the factor . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
3015567	0	0	Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial - portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback .
3015567	1	146	Nitroprusside - induced hypotension evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor ( irCRF ) into the hypophysial - portal circulation .
3015567	2	350	Portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradigm .
3015567	3	468	Application of a delayed feedback signal , in the form of a 2 - h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane - anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis , is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose tested .
3015567	4	777	Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate , which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms / dl .
3015567	5	933	Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to nitroprusside - induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8 - 12 micrograms / dl .
3015567	6	1097	These studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of irCRF release .
3031535	0	0	Noradrenergic involvement in catalepsy induced by delta 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol .
3031535	1	80	In order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of delta 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the effect of pretreatment with 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) or with desipramine and 6 - OHDA and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats .
3031535	2	363	The cataleptogenic effect of THC was significantly reduced in rats treated with 6 - OHDA and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with desipramine and 6 - OHDA , as compared with control rats .
3031535	3	582	On the contrary , the cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol was significantly reduced in rats treated with desipramine and 6 - OHDA but not in rats treated with 6 - OHDA or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus .
3031535	4	794	These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of catalepsy induced by THC , whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in catalepsy induced by haloperidol .
3070035	0	0	Reversibility of captopril - induced renal insufficiency after prolonged use in an unusual case of renovascular hypertension .
3070035	1	124	We report a case of severe hypertension with an occluded renal artery to a solitary kidney , who developed sudden deterioration of renal function following treatment with captopril .
3070035	2	305	His renal function remained impaired but stable during 2 years ' treatment with captopril but returned to pre - treatment levels soon after cessation of the drug .
3070035	3	465	This indicates reversibility in captopril - induced renal failure even after its prolonged use and suggests that no organic damage occurs to glomerular arterioles following chronic ACE inhibition .
3076126	0	0	HMG CoA reductase inhibitors .
3076126	1	30	Current clinical experience .
3076126	2	59	Lovastatin and simvastatin are the 2 best - known members of the class of hypolipidaemic agents known as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors .
3076126	3	192	Clinical experience with lovastatin includes over 5000 patients , 700 of whom have been treated for 2 years or more , and experience with simvastatin includes over 3500 patients , of whom 350 have been treated for 18 months or more .
3076126	4	422	Lovastatin has been marketed in the United States for over 6 months .
3076126	5	491	Both agents show substantial clinical efficacy , with reductions in total cholesterol of over 30 % and in LDL - cholesterol of 40 % in clinical studies .
3076126	6	639	Modest increases in HDL - cholesterol levels of about 10 % are also reported .
3076126	7	714	Clinical tolerability of both agents has been good , with fewer than 3 % of patients withdrawn from treatment because of clinical adverse experiences .
3076126	8	863	Ophthalmological examinations in over 1100 patients treated with one or the other agent have revealed no evidence of significant short term ( up to 2 years ) cataractogenic potential .
3076126	9	1045	One to 2 % of patients have elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal .
3076126	10	1157	These episodes are asymptomatic and reversible when therapy is discontinued .
3076126	11	1234	Minor elevations of creatine kinase levels are reported in about 5 % of patients .
3076126	12	1315	Myopathy , associated in some cases with myoglobinuria , and in 2 cases with transient renal failure , has been rarely reported with lovastatin , especially in patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporin , gemfibrozil or niacin .
3076126	13	1543	Lovastatin and simvastatin are both effective and well - tolerated agents for lowering elevated levels of serum cholesterol .
3076126	14	1666	As wider use confirms their safety profile , they will gain increasing importance in the therapeutic approach to hypercholesterolaemia and its consequences .
3101906	0	0	Hepatic reactions associated with ketoconazole in the United Kingdom .
3101906	1	70	Ketoconazole was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1981 .
3101906	2	129	By November 1984 the Committee on Safety of Medicines had received 82 reports of possible hepatotoxicity associated with the drug , including five deaths .
3101906	3	283	An analysis of the 75 cases that had been adequately followed up suggested that 16 , including three deaths , were probably related to treatment with the drug .
3101906	4	441	Of the remainder , 48 were possibly related to treatment , five were unlikely to be so , and six were unclassifiable .
3101906	5	556	The mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 57 . 9 , with hepatotoxicity being more common in women .
3101906	6	664	The average duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 days .
3101906	7	740	None of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment .
3101906	8	826	The results of serum liver function tests suggested hepatocellular injury in 10 ( 63 % ) ; the rest showed a mixed pattern .
3101906	9	946	In contrast , the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis .
3101906	10	1050	The characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were similar .
3101906	11	1125	Allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were rare .
3101906	12	1190	Hepatitis was usually reversible when treatment was stopped , with the results of liver function tests returning to normal after an average of 3 . 1 months .
3101906	13	1344	In two of the three deaths probably associated with ketoconazole treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of jaundice and other symptoms of hepatitis .
3101906	14	1508	Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of hepatitis is advised during long term treatment with ketoconazole to prevent possible serious hepatic injury .
3107448	0	0	Glyburide - induced hepatitis .
3107448	1	29	Drug - induced hepatotoxicity , although common , has been reported only infrequently with sulfonylureas .
3107448	2	131	For glyburide , a second - generation sulfonylurea , only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist .
3107448	3	228	Two patients with type II diabetes mellitus developed an acute hepatitis - like syndrome soon after initiation of glyburide therapy .
3107448	4	359	There was no serologic evidence of viral infection , and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with drug - induced hepatitis .
3107448	5	505	Both patients recovered quickly after stopping glyburide therapy and have remained well for a follow - up period of 1 year .
3107448	6	627	Glyburide can produce an acute hepatitis - like illness in some persons .
3125768	0	0	Intracranial pressure increases during alfentanil - induced rigidity .
3125768	1	68	Intracranial pressure ( ICP ) was measured during alfentanil - induced rigidity in rats .
3125768	2	153	Ten rats had arterial , central venous ( CVP ) , and subdural cannulae inserted under halothane anesthesia .
3125768	3	257	The animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia ( PCO2 = 42 + / - 1 mmHg , mean + / - SE ) .
3125768	4	358	Following instrumentation , halothane was discontinued and alfentanil ( 125 mu / kg ) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesia .
3125768	5	499	In the five rats that developed somatic rigidity , ICP and CVP increased significantly above baseline ( delta ICP 7 . 5 + / - 1 . 0 mmHg , delta CVP 5 . 9 + / - 1 . 3 mmHg ) .
3125768	6	658	These variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with metocurine .
3125768	7	740	In five rats that did not become rigid , ICP and CVP did not change following alfentanil .
3125768	8	829	These observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil , and , presumably , other opiates , are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems .
3173179	0	0	Verapamil withdrawal as a possible cause of myocardial infarction in a hypertensive woman with a normal coronary angiogram .
3173179	1	124	Verapamil is an effective and relatively - safe antihypertensive drug .
3173179	2	193	Serious adverse effects are uncommon and mainly have been related to the depression of cardiac contractility and conduction , especially when the drug is combined with beta - blocking agents .
3173179	3	382	We report a case in which myocardial infarction coincided with the introduction of captopril and the withdrawal of verapamil in a previously asymptomatic woman with severe hypertension .
3173179	4	568	Possible mechanisms that involve a verapamil - related increase in platelet and / or vascular alpha 2 - adrenoreceptor affinity for catecholamines are discussed .
3173180	0	0	Haemolytic - uraemic syndrome after treatment with metronidazole .
3173180	1	64	This paper describes the clinical features of six children who developed the haemolytic - uraemic syndrome after treatment with metronidazole .
3173180	2	205	These children were older and were more likely to have undergone recent bowel surgery than are other children with this condition .
3173180	3	336	While the involvement of metronidazole in the aetiology of the haemolytic - uraemic syndrome is not established firmly , the action of this drug in sensitizing tissues to oxidation injury and the reported evidence of oxidation changes in the haemolytic - uraemic syndrome suggest a possible link between metronidazole treatment and some cases of the haemolytic - uraemic syndrome .
3187073	0	0	Adverse cardiac effects during induction chemotherapy treatment with cis - platin and 5 - fluorouracil .
3187073	1	100	Survival for patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma and esophageal carcinoma is poor with radiotherapy and / or surgery .
3187073	2	227	Obviously , there is a need for effective chemotherapy .
3187073	3	282	In the present study , cis - platin ( 80 - 120 mg / m2BSA ) and 5 - FU ( 1000 mg / m2BSA daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days ) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery .
3187073	4	462	The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment .
3187073	5	571	Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed .
3187073	6	685	In the pre - treatment evaluation , signs of cardiovascular disease were found in 33 patients ( 43 % ) .
3187073	7	783	During treatment , adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients ( 18 % ) .
3187073	8	861	The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group , 64 years .
3187073	9	940	The incidence of cardiotoxicity was not higher in patients with signs of cardiovascular disease than in those without in the pre - treatment evaluation .
3187073	10	1091	The most common signs of cardiotoxicity were chest pain , ST - T wave changes and atrial fibrillation .
3187073	11	1191	This was followed by ventricular fibrillation in one patient and sudden death in another .
3187073	12	1281	It is concluded that patients on 5 - FU treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if chest pain or tachyarrhythmia is observed .
3192036	0	0	Death from chemotherapy in gestational trophoblastic disease .
3192036	1	62	Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high - risk stage of choriocarcinoma .
3192036	2	192	Based on this principle a 27 - year old woman , classified as being in the high - risk group ( Goldstein and Berkowitz score : 11 ) , was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs .
3192036	3	360	The multiple drug schema consisted of : Etoposide 16 . 213 , Methotrexate , Cyclophosphamide , Actomycin - D , and Cisplatin .
3192036	4	477	On the first day of the schedule , moderate high doses of Methotrexate , Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered .
3192036	5	598	Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs , probably originating from the uterus .
3192036	6	799	Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins , which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces ; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli .
3192036	7	1121	In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations , such as spontaneous necrosis , must be considered less likely .
3192036	8	1315	Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are , according to existing classifications , at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance .
3192036	9	1450	Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment , especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug .

322550	1	95	The effects of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt ( QS / QT ) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40 - 50 per cent .
322550	2	345	Before nitroprusside infusion , 5 cm H2O CPAP significantly , P less than . 05 , decreased arterial blood pressure , but did not significantly alter heart rate , cardiac output , systemic vascular resistance , or QS / QT .
322550	3	557	Ten cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and QS / QT .
322550	4	737	Nitroprusside caused significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate , but did not change cardiac output or QS / QT .
322550	5	913	Five cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside did not further alter any of the above - mentioned variables .
322550	6	1011	However , 10 cm H2O CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure , cardiac output , and QS / QT .
322550	7	1097	These data indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40 - 50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS / QT .
322550	8	1251	During nitroprusside infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics , but high levels of CPAP ( 10 cm H2O ) , while decreasing QS / QT , produce marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output .
3341566	0	0	Systolic pressure variation is greater during hemorrhage than during sodium nitroprusside - induced hypotension in ventilated dogs .
3341566	1	130	The systolic pressure variation ( SPV ) , which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) after one positive - pressure breath , was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension .
3341566	2	362	Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage ( HEM , n = 7 ) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside ( SNP , n = 7 ) .
3341566	3	524	During HEM - induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group .
3341566	4	675	The systemic , central venous , pulmonary capillary wedge pressures , and heart rates , were similar in the two groups .
3341566	5	791	Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups .
3341566	6	909	The SPV during hypotension was 15 . 7 + / - 6 . 7 mm Hg in the HEM group , compared with 9 . 1 + / - 2 . 0 mm Hg in the SNP group ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .
3341566	7	1046	The delta down , which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath , was 20 . 3 + / - 8 . 4 and 10 . 1 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups , respectively , during hypotension ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .
3341566	8	1249	It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in preload .
3341566	9	1394	They are thus more important during absolute hypovolemia than during deliberate hypotension .
3358181	0	0	Ventricular tachyarrhythmias during cesarean section after ritodrine therapy : interaction with anesthetics .
3358181	1	108	This case illustrates that patients receiving ritodrine for preterm labor may risk interactions between the residual betamimetic effects of ritodrine and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean section .
3358181	2	314	Such interactions may result in serious cardiovascular complications even after cessation of an infusion of ritodrine .
3358181	3	433	Preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum potassium level .
3358181	4	522	Delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possible .
3358181	5	595	Careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of ephedrine are advised .
3358181	6	685	After delivery of the infant , there should be no contraindication to the use of an alpha - adrenergic vasopressor such as phenylephrine to treat hypotensive patients with tachycardia .
3371379	0	0	Verapamil - induced carbamazepine neurotoxicity .
3371379	1	47	A report of two cases .
3371379	2	70	Two patients with signs of carbamazepine neurotoxicity after combined treatment with verapamil showed complete recovery after discontinuation of the calcium entry blocker .
3371379	3	242	Use of verapamil in combination with carbamazepine should either be avoided or prescribed only with appropriate adjustment of the carbamazepine dose ( usually reduction of the carbamazepine dose by one half ) .
3403780	0	0	Paracetamol - associated coma , metabolic acidosis , renal and hepatic failure .
3403780	1	76	A case of metabolic acidosis , acute renal failure and hepatic failure following paracetamol ingestion is presented .
3403780	2	192	The diagnostic difficulty at presentation is highlighted .
3403780	3	250	Continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration proved a valuable means of maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance .
3403780	4	361	The patient recovered .
3409645	0	0	Sexual dysfunction among patients with arthritis .
3409645	1	50	The relationship of arthritis and sexual dysfunction was investigated among 169 patients with rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis and spondyloarthropathy , 130 of whom were pair - matched to controls .
3409645	2	249	Assessments of marital happiness and depressed mood were also made using the CES - D and the Azrin Marital Happiness Scale ( AMHS ) .
3409645	3	378	Sexual dysfunctions were found to be common among patients and controls , the majority in both groups reporting one or more dysfunctions .
3409645	4	515	Impotence was more common among male patients than controls and was found to be associated with co - morbidity and the taking of methotrexate .
3409645	5	656	Depressed mood was more common among patients and was associated with certain sexual difficulties , but not with impotence .
3409645	6	779	Marital unhappiness , as indicated by AMHS scores , was not associated with arthritis but was associated with sexual dysfunction , sexual dissatisfaction and being female .
3412544	0	0	Does paracetamol cause urothelial cancer or renal papillary necrosis ?
3412544	1	70	The risk of developing renal papillary necrosis or cancer of the renal pelvis , ureter or bladder associated with consumption of either phenacetin or paracetamol was calculated from data acquired by questionnaire from 381 cases and 808 controls .
3412544	2	315	The risk of renal papillary necrosis was increased nearly 20 - fold by consumption of phenacetin , which also increased the risk for cancer of the renal pelvis and bladder but not for ureteric cancer .
3412544	3	513	By contrast , we were unable to substantiate an increased risk from paracetamol consumption for renal papillary necrosis or any of these cancers although there was a suggestion of an association with cancer of the ureter .
3425586	0	0	Dapsone - associated Heinz body hemolytic anemia in a Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait .
3425586	1	93	A Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait ( AE ) and leprosy developed a Heinz body hemolytic anemia while taking a dose of dapsone ( 50 mg / day ) not usually associated with clinical hemolysis .
3425586	2	283	Her red blood cells ( RBCs ) had increased incubated Heinz body formation , decreased reduced glutathione ( GSH ) , and decreased GSH stability .
3425586	3	422	The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the dapsone - exposed AE RBCs was increased compared to normal RBCs .
3425586	4	529	Although the AE RBCs from an individual not taking dapsone had increased incubated Heinz body formation , the GSH content and GSH stability were normal .
3425586	5	681	The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the non - dapsone - exposed AE RBCs was decreased compared to normal RBCs .
3425586	6	792	Thus , AE RBCs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo , since dapsone does not cause hemolytic anemia at this dose in hematologically normal individuals .
3425586	7	989	Given the influx of Southeast Asians into the United States , oxidant medications should be used with caution , especially if an infection is present , in individuals of ethnic backgrounds that have an increased prevalence of hemoglobin E .
3437726	0	0	Severe complications of antianginal drug therapy in a patient identified as a poor metabolizer of metoprolol , propafenone , diltiazem , and sparteine .
3437726	1	149	A 47 - year - old patient suffering from coronary artery disease was admitted to the CCU in shock with III .
3437726	2	253	AV block , severe hypotension , and impairment of ventricular function .
3437726	3	323	One week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of metoprolol ( 100 mg t . i . d . and then 100 mg b . i . d . ) had been initiated .
3437726	4	454	Two days before admission diltiazem ( 60 mg b . i . d . ) was prescribed in addition .
3437726	5	533	Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol ( greater than 3000 ng / ml ) and diltiazem ( 526 ng / ml ) .
3437726	6	673	The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy .
3437726	7	759	Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol , diltiazem , propafenone ( since he had received this drug in the past ) , and sparteine ( as a probe for the debrisoquine / sparteine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism ) .
3437726	8	1010	It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs , indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control .
3437726	9	1141	Therefore , patients belonging to the poor - metabolizer phenotype of sparteine / debrisoquine polymorphism in drug metabolism , which constitutes 6 . 4 % of the German population , may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone .
3437726	10	1413	Moreover , the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients .
347884	0	0	Clinical experiences in an open and a double - blind trial .
347884	1	58	A total of sixty patients were trated with bromperidol first in open conditions ( 20 patients ) , then on a double blind basis ( 40 patients ) with haloperidol as the reference substance .
347884	2	241	The open study lasted for four weeks ; the drug was administrated in the form of 1 mg tablets .
347884	3	335	The daily dose ( initial dose : 1 mg ; mean dose at the end of the trial : 4 . 47 mg ) was always administered in one single dose .
347884	4	459	Nineteen patients finished the trial , and in 18 cases the therapeutic result was considered very good to good .
347884	5	570	These results were confirmed by statistical analysis .
347884	6	624	Nine patients exhibited mild to moderate extrapyramidal concomitant symptoms ; no other side effects were observed .
347884	7	739	The results of detailed laboratory tests and evaluations of various quantitative and qualitative tolerability parameters were not indicative of toxic effects .
347884	8	898	In the double blind study with haloperidol , both substances were found to be highly effective in the treatment of psychotic syndromes belonging predominantly to the schizophrenia group .
347884	9	1084	Certain clues , including the onset of action , seem to be indicative of the superiority of bromperidol .
347884	10	1187	No differences were observed with respect to side effects and general tolerability .
3496378	0	0	Prolonged cholestasis after troleandomycin - induced acute hepatitis .
3496378	1	68	We report the case of a patient in whom troleandomycin - induced hepatitis was followed by prolonged anicteric cholestasis .
3496378	2	190	Jaundice occurred after administration of troleandomycin for 7 days and was associated with hypereosinophilia .
3496378	3	301	Jaundice disappeared within 3 months but was followed by prolonged anicteric cholestasis marked by pruritus and high levels of alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyltransferase activities .
3496378	4	490	Finally , pruritus disappeared within 19 months , and liver tests returned to normal 27 months after the onset of hepatitis .
3496378	5	613	This observation demonstrates that prolonged cholestasis can follow troleandomycin - induced acute hepatitis .
3503576	0	0	Serial studies of auditory neurotoxicity in patients receiving deferoxamine therapy .
3503576	1	85	Visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion - dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous deferoxamine .
3503576	2	280	Twenty - two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4 , 000 to 8 , 000 Hz and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels .
3503576	3	475	When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed , audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks , and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic .
3503576	4	699	Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability .
3503576	5	818	Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg / kg per dose , therapy was restarted with lower doses , usually 50 mg / kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality , and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated .
3503576	6	1144	Auditory deterioration and improvement , demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine , respectively , provided convincing evidence for a cause - and - effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity .
3503576	7	1399	Based on these data , a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine .
3503576	8	1518	A dose of 50 mg / kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities .
3503576	9	1594	With mild toxicity , a reduction to 30 or 40 mg / kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks .
3503576	10	1734	Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg / kg per dose with careful monitoring .
3503576	11	1839	In those with symptoms of hearing loss , the drug should be stopped for four weeks , and when the audiogram is stable or improved , therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg / kg per dose .
3503576	12	2024	Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction .
354896	0	0	Lidocaine - induced cardiac asystole .
354896	1	36	Intravenous administration of a single 50 - mg bolus of lidocaine in a 67 - year - old man resulted in profound depression of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers .
354896	2	226	The patient had no apparent associated conditions which might have predisposed him to the development of bradyarrhythmias ; and , thus , this probably represented a true idiosyncrasy to lidocaine .
3560095	0	0	Flurbiprofen in the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis .
3560095	1	64	Thirty - four patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , who were treated with flurbiprofen at a maximum dose of 4 mg / kg / day , had statistically significant decreases from baseline in 6 arthritis indices after 12 weeks of treatment .
3560095	2	296	Improvements were seen in the number of tender joints , the severity of swelling and tenderness , the time of walk 50 feet , the duration of morning stiffness and the circumference of the left knee .
3560095	3	492	The most frequently observed side effect was fecal occult blood ( 25 % of patients ) ; however , there was no other evidence of gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding in these patients .
3560095	4	665	One patient was prematurely discontinued from the study for severe headache and abdominal pain .
3560095	5	761	Most side effects were mild and related to the GI tract .
3560096	0	0	Hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy .
3560096	1	47	Hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents ( NSAID ) such as indomethacin .
3560096	2	177	Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac , owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis .
3560096	3	323	We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6 . 1 to 6 . 9 mEq / l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration .
3560096	4	454	In all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac .
3560096	5	548	As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly , this course of events is suggestive of a cause - and - effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia .
3560096	6	740	These observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified .
3564823	0	0	Drug - induced arterial spasm relieved by lidocaine .
3564823	1	51	Case report .
3564823	2	64	Following major intracranial surgery in a 35 - year - old man , sodium pentothal was intravenously infused to minimize cerebral ischaemia .
3564823	3	198	Intense vasospasm with threatened gangrene arose in the arm used for the infusion .
3564823	4	281	Since the cranial condition precluded use of more usual methods , lidocaine was given intra - arterially , with careful cardiovascular monitoring , to counteract the vasospasm .
3564823	5	453	The treatment was rapidly successful .
3615541	0	0	Regional localization of the antagonism of amphetamine - induced hyperactivity by intracerebral calcitonin injections .
3615541	1	117	Calcitonin receptors are found in the brain , and intracerebral infusions of calcitonin can produce behavioral effects .
3615541	2	236	Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in amphetamine - induced locomotor activity .
3615541	3	353	In previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of calcitonin into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens .
3615541	4	531	In the present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake .
3615541	5	671	The areas where calcitonin is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens , suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of calcitonin in inhibiting amphetamine - induced locomotor activity .
3629586	0	0	The hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog : a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man .
3629586	1	122	Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man , the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized .
3629586	2	275	There is a need for a well - defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied .
3629586	3	371	In four subacute toxicity studies , the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose - dependent incidence of anemia , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia after 1 - 3 months of treatment .
3629586	4	589	A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50 % of dogs receiving 400 - 500 mg / kg cefonicid or 540 - 840 mg / kg cefazedone .
3629586	5	763	All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment ; the time required for recovery of the erythron ( approximately 1 month ) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets ( hours to a few days ) .
3629586	6	1007	Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin , the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested ; cefonicid ( but not cefazedone ) - treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period ( 15 + / - 5 days ) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug ( 61 + / - 24 days ) .
3629586	7	1289	This observation , along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs , suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia .
3629586	8	1541	We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin - induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders .
3676049	0	0	Cerebral blood flow and metabolism during isoflurane - induced hypotension in patients subjected to surgery for cerebral aneurysms .
3676049	1	130	Cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were measured during isoflurane - induced hypotension in 10 patients subjected to craniotomy for clipping of a cerebral aneurysm .
3676049	2	317	Flow and metabolism were measured 5 - 13 days after the subarachnoid haemorrhage by a modification of the classical Kety - Schmidt technique using xenon - 133 i . v . Anaesthesia was maintained with an inspired isoflurane concentration of 0 . 75 % ( plus 67 % nitrous oxide in oxygen ) , during which CBF and CMRO2 were 34 . 3 + / - 2 . 1 ml / 100 g min - 1 and 2 . 32 + / - 0 . 16 ml / 100 g min - 1 at PaCO2 4 . 1 + / - 0 . 1 kPa ( mean + / - SEM ) .
3676049	3	723	Controlled hypotension to an average MAP of 50 - 55 mm Hg was induced by increasing the dose of isoflurane , and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2 . 2 + / - 0 . 2 % .
3676049	4	890	This resulted in a significant decrease in CMRO2 ( to 1 . 73 + / - 0 . 16 ml / 100 g min - 1 ) , while CBF was unchanged .
3676049	5	999	After the clipping of the aneurysm the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 0 . 75 % .
3676049	6	1085	There was a significant increase in CBF , although CMRO2 was unchanged , compared with pre - hypotensive values .
3676049	7	1194	These changes might offer protection to brain tissue during periods of induced hypotension .
3693336	0	0	Triazolam - induced brief episodes of secondary mania in a depressed patient .
3693336	1	76	Large doses of triazolam repeatedly induced brief episodes of mania in a depressed elderly woman .
3693336	2	174	Features of organic mental disorder ( delirium ) were not present .
3693336	3	239	Manic excitement was coincident with the duration of action of triazolam .
3693336	4	313	The possible contribution of the triazolo group to changes in affective status is discussed .
3714122	0	0	The correlation between neurotoxic esterase inhibition and mipafox - induced neuropathic damage in rats .
3714122	1	103	The correlation between neuropathic damage and inhibition of neurotoxic esterase or neuropathy target enzyme ( NTE ) was examined in rats acutely exposed to Mipafox ( N , N ' - diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate ) , a neurotoxic organophosphate .
3714122	2	343	Brain and spinal cord NTE activities were measured in Long - Evans male rats 1 hr post - exposure to various dosages of Mipafox ( ip , 1 - 15 mg / kg ) .
3714122	3	485	These data were correlated with histologically scored cervical cord damage in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14 - 21 days post - exposure .
3714122	4	638	Those dosages ( greater than or equal to 10 mg / kg ) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73 % and brain greater than or equal to 67 % of control values produced severe ( greater than or equal to 3 ) cervical cord pathology in 85 % of the rats .
3714122	5	915	In contrast , dosages of Mipafox ( less than or equal to 5 mg / kg ) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61 % and brain less than or equal to 60 % produced this degree of cord damage in only 9 % of the animals .
3714122	6	1153	These data indicate that a critical percentage of NTE inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after Mipafox exposure can predict neuropathic damage in rats several weeks later .
3719553	0	0	Allergic reaction to 5 - fluorouracil infusion .
3719553	1	46	An allergic reaction consisting of angioneurotic edema secondary to continuous infusion 5 - fluorouracil occurred in a patient with recurrent carcinoma of the oral cavity , cirrhosis , and cisplatin - induced impaired renal function .
3719553	2	274	This reaction occurred during the sixth and seventh courses of infusional chemotherapy .
3719553	3	362	Oral diphenhydramine and prednisone were ineffective in preventing the recurrence of the allergic reaction .
3719553	4	470	Discontinuance of effective chemotherapy in this patient during partial remission resulted in fatal disease progression .
3750012	0	0	Myasthenia gravis caused by penicillamine and chloroquine therapy for rheumatoid arthritis .
3750012	1	92	We have described a unique patient who had reversible and dose - related myasthenia gravis after penicillamine and chloroquine therapy for rheumatoid arthritis .
3750012	2	251	Although acetylcholine receptor antibodies were not detectable , the time course was consistent with an autoimmune process .
3780846	0	0	On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine in rats .
3780846	1	105	The development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rats .
3780846	2	201	Saline - pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine ( 20 mg / kg i . p . ) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram .
3780846	3	353	Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36 - 40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance : about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic ( A group ) .
3780846	4	628	The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped ( S ) licking and / or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic ( K ) behaviour ( AS / KS group ) , suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation .
3780846	5	859	The rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days ' treatment .
3780846	6	940	In a further series of experiments , haloperidol ( 0 . 2 mg / kg i . p . ) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference .
3780846	7	1164	Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group .
3780846	8	1214	However , the level in the AS / KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group .
3780846	9	1301	The results suggest that rigidity , which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum , can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum .
3780846	10	1495	Nevertheless , there occurs some real tolerance to this effect .
3780846	11	1558	The rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS / KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA - innervated structures .
3782049	0	0	A case of massive rhabdomyolysis following molindone administration .
3782049	1	69	Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially lethal syndrome that psychiatric patients seem predisposed to develop .
3782049	2	172	The clinical signs and symptoms , typical laboratory features , and complications of rhabdomyolysis are presented .
3782049	3	285	The case of a schizophrenic patient is reported to illustrate massive rhabdomyolysis and subsequent acute renal failure following molindone administration .
3782049	4	441	Physicians who prescribe molindone should be aware of this reaction .
3800626	0	0	Compression neuropathy of the radial nerve due to pentazocine - induced fibrous myopathy .
3800626	1	88	Fibrous myopathy is a common , well - known side effect of repeated pentazocine injection .
3800626	2	176	However , compression neuropathy due to fibrotic muscle affected by pentazocine - induced myopathy has not previously been reported .
3800626	3	306	In a 37 - year - old woman with documented pentazocine - induced fibrous myopathy of triceps and deltoid muscles bilaterally and a three - week history of right wrist drop , electrodiagnostic examination showed a severe but partial lesion of the right radial nerve distal to the branches to the triceps , in addition to the fibrous myopathy .
3800626	4	638	Surgery revealed the right radial nerve to be severely compressed by the densely fibrotic lateral head of the triceps .
3800626	5	757	Decompression and neurolysis were performed with good subsequent recovery of function .
3827439	0	0	Recurrent reversible acute renal failure from amphotericin .
3827439	1	60	A patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis and disseminated sporotrichosis developed acute renal failure immediately following the administration of amphotericin B on four separate occasions .
3827439	2	246	The abruptness of the renal failure and its reversibility within days suggests that there was a functional component to the renal dysfunction .
3827439	3	389	We propose that amphotericin , in the setting of reduced effective arterial volume , may activate tubuloglomerular feedback , thereby contributing to acute renal failure .
3828020	0	0	Cerebral infarction with a single oral dose of phenylpropanolamine .
3828020	1	68	Phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) , a synthetic sympathomimetic that is structurally similar to amphetamine , is available over the counter in anorectics , nasal congestants , and cold preparations .
3828020	2	255	Its prolonged use or overuse has been associated with seizures , intracerebral hemorrhage , neuropsychiatric symptoms , and nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction .
3828020	3	412	We report the case of a young woman who suffered a cerebral infarction after taking a single oral dose of PPA .
3856631	0	0	Remission induction of meningeal leukemia with high - dose intravenous methotrexate .
3856631	1	83	Twenty children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed meningeal disease were treated with a high - dose intravenous methotrexate regimen that was designed to achieve and maintain CSF methotrexate concentrations of 10 ( - 5 ) mol / L without the need for concomitant intrathecal dosing .
3856631	2	371	The methotrexate was administered as a loading dose of 6 , 000 mg / m2 for a period of one hour followed by an infusion of 1 , 200 mg / m2 / h for 23 hours .
3856631	3	518	Leucovorin rescue was initiated 12 hours after the end of the infusion with a loading dose of 200 mg / m2 followed by 12 mg / m2 every three hours for six doses and then every six hours until the plasma methotrexate level decreased to less than 1 X 10 ( - 7 ) mol / L .
3856631	4	777	The mean steady - state plasma and CSF methotrexate concentrations achieved were 1 . 1 X 10 ( - 3 ) mol / L and 3 . 6 X 10 ( - 5 ) mol / L , respectively .
3856631	5	913	All 20 patients responded to this regimen , 16 / 20 ( 80 % ) achieved a complete remission , and 20 % obtained a partial remission .
3856631	6	1037	The most common toxicities encountered were transient serum transaminase and bilirubin elevations , neutropenia , and mucositis .
3856631	7	1164	One patient had focal seizures and transient hemiparesis but recovered completely .
3856631	8	1247	High - dose intravenous methotrexate is an effective treatment for the induction of remission after meningeal relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
3865016	0	0	Interaction of cyclosporin A with antineoplastic agents .
3865016	1	57	A synergistic effect of etoposide and cyclosporin A was observed in a patient with acute T - lymphocytic leukemia in relapse .
3865016	2	181	The concomitant administration of etoposide and cyclosporin A resulted in eradication of hitherto refractory leukemic infiltration of bone marrow .
3865016	3	328	Severe side effects in terms of mental confusion and progressive hyperbilirubinemia , however , point to an enhancement not only of antineoplastic effects but also of toxicity in normal tissues .
3865016	4	521	This report demonstrates for the first time that the pharmacodynamic properties of cyclosporin A may not be confined strictly to suppression of normal T - cell functions .
3970039	0	0	Incidence of neoplasms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to different treatment regimens .
3970039	1	102	Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis .
3970039	2	225	The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil ( alkylating agents ) , azathioprine ( purine analogue ) , and methotrexate ( folic acid analogue ) .
3970039	3	380	There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis , but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped .
3970039	4	526	Since adverse reactions are frequent , less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year .
3970039	5	660	Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects , those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it .
3970039	6	805	Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia , and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma .
3970039	7	1024	Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder .
3970039	8	1097	There have been several long - term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased .
3970039	9	1290	Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected , and until further information is available , the use of immunosuppressive drugs , particularly alkylating agents , in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life - threatening complications .
3985451	0	0	Warfarin - induced iliopsoas hemorrhage with subsequent femoral nerve palsy .
3985451	1	75	We present the case of a 28 - year - old man on chronic warfarin therapy who sustained a minor muscle tear and developed increasing pain and a flexure contracture of the right hip .
3985451	2	252	Surgical exploration revealed an iliopsoas hematoma and femoral nerve entrapment , resulting in a femoral nerve palsy and partial loss of quadriceps functions .
3985451	3	411	Anticoagulant - induced femoral nerve palsy represents the most common form of warfarin - induced peripheral neuropathy ; it is characterized by severe pain in the inguinal region , varying degrees of motor and sensory impairment , and flexure contracture of the involved extremity .
3997294	0	0	Pneumonitis with pleural and pericardial effusion and neuropathy during amiodarone therapy .
3997294	1	92	A patient with sinuatrial disease and implanted pacemaker was treated with amiodarone ( maximum dose 1000 mg , maintenance dose 800 mg daily ) for 10 months , for control of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias .
3997294	2	297	He developed pneumonitis , pleural and pericardial effusions , and a predominantly proximal motor neuropathy .
3997294	3	405	Immediate but gradual improvement followed withdrawal of amiodarone and treatment with prednisolone .
3997294	4	506	Review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of amiodarone pneumonitis , immediate withdrawal of amiodarone , and prompt but continued steroid therapy to ensure full recovery .
4008111	0	0	Amiodarone - induced sinoatrial block .
4008111	1	37	We observed sinoatrial block due to chronic amiodarone administration in a 5 - year - old boy with primary cardiomyopathy , Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome and supraventricular tachycardia .
4008111	2	221	Reduction in the dosage of amiodarone resulted in the disappearance of the sinoatrial block and the persistence of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia .
4027862	0	0	Desipramine - induced delirium at " subtherapeutic " concentrations : a case report .
4027862	1	80	An elderly patient treated with low dose Desipramine developed a delirium while her plasma level was in the " subtherapeutic " range .
4027862	2	212	Delirium , which may be induced by tricyclic drug therapy in the elderly , can be caused by tricyclics with low anticholinergic potency .
4027862	3	347	Therapeutic ranges for antidepressants that have been derived from general adult population studies may not be appropriate for the elderly .
4027862	4	487	Further studies of specifically elderly patients are now required to establish safer and more appropriate guidelines for drug therapy .
4071154	0	0	Indomethacin - induced renal insufficiency : recurrence on rechallenge .
4071154	1	69	We have reported a case of acute oliguric renal failure with hyperkalemia in a patient with cirrhosis , ascites , and cor pulmonale after indomethacin therapy .
4071154	2	227	Prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal , while re - exposure to a single dose of indomethacin caused recurrence of acute reversible oliguria .
4071154	3	389	Our case supports the hypothesis that endogenous renal prostaglandins play a role in the maintenance of renal blood flow when circulating plasma volume is diminished .
4071154	4	556	Since nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory agents interfere with this compensatory mechanism and may cause acute renal failure , they should be used with caution in such patients .
424937	0	0	Patterns of hepatic injury induced by methyldopa .
424937	1	50	Twelve patients with liver disease related to methyldopa were seen between 1967 and 1977 .
424937	2	140	Illness occurred within 1 - - 9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients , the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months , 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms .
424937	3	334	Jaundice with tender hepatomegaly , usually preceded by symptoms of malaise , anorexia , nausea and vomiting , and associated with upper abdominal pain , was an invariable finding in all patients .
424937	4	526	Biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular necrosis and correlated with histopathological evidence of hepatic injury , the spectrum of which ranged from fatty change and focal hepatocellular necrosis to massive hepatic necrosis .
424937	5	769	Most patients showed moderate to severe acute hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis with associated cholestasis .
424937	6	882	The drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients , with rapid clinical improvement in 9 .
424937	7	987	One patient died , having presented in hepatic failure , and another , who had been taking methyldopa for 7 years , showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months .
424937	8	1182	The remaining patient in the series developed fulminant hepatitis when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of methyldopa - induced hepatitis .
424937	9	1353	In this latter patient , and in 2 others , the causal relationship between methyldopa and hepatic dysfunction was proved with the recurrence of hepatitis within 2 weeks of re - exposure to the drug .
435349	0	0	Suxamethonium infusion rate and observed fasciculations .
435349	1	57	A dose - response study .
435349	2	80	Suxamethonium chloride ( Sch ) was administered i . v . to 36 adult males at six rates : 0 . 25 mg s - 1 to 20 mg s - 1 .
435349	3	189	The infusion was discontinued either when there was no muscular response to tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when Sch 120 mg was exceeded .
435349	4	337	Six additional patients received a 30 - mg i . v . bolus dose .
435349	5	395	Fasciculations in six areas of the body were scored from 0 to 3 and summated as a total fasciculation score .
435349	6	504	The times to first fasciculation , twitch suppression and tetanus suppression were inversely related to the infusion rates .
435349	7	627	Fasciculations in the six areas and the total fasciculation score were related directly to the rate of infusion .
435349	8	740	Total fasciculation scores in the 30 - mg bolus group and the 5 - mg s - 1 and 20 - mg s - 1 infusion groups were not significantly different .
4812392	0	0	Treatment of psoriasis with azathioprine .
4812392	1	42	Azathioprine treatment benefited 19 ( 66 % ) out of 29 patients suffering from severe psoriasis .
4812392	2	136	Haematological complications were not troublesome and results of biochemical liver function tests remained normal .
4812392	3	251	Minimal cholestasis was seen in two cases and portal fibrosis of a reversible degree in eight .
4812392	4	346	Liver biopsies should be undertaken at regular intervals if azathioprine therapy is continued so that structural liver damage may be detected at an early and reversible stage .
567256	0	0	Angiosarcoma of the liver associated with diethylstilbestrol .
567256	1	62	Angiosarcoma of the liver occurred in a 76 - year - old man who had been treated for a well - differentiated adenocarcinoma of the liver with diethylstilbestrol for 13 years .
567256	2	231	Angiosarcoma was also present within pulmonary and renal arteries .
567256	3	298	The possibility that the intraarterial lesions might represent independent primary tumors is considered .
603022	0	0	Galanthamine hydrobromide , a longer acting anticholinesterase drug , in the treatment of the central effects of scopolamine ( Hyoscine ) .
603022	1	135	Galanthamine hydrobromide , an anticholinesterase drug capable of penetrating the blood - brain barrier , was used in a patient demonstrating central effects of scopolamine ( hyoscine ) overdosage .
603022	2	327	It is longer acting than physostigmine and is used in anaesthesia to reverse the non - depolarizing neuromuscular block .
603022	3	446	However , studies into the dose necessary to combating scopolamine intoxication are indicated .
6103707	0	0	Comparison of the subjective effects and plasma concentrations following oral and i . m . administration of flunitrazepam in volunteers .
6103707	1	134	Flunitrazepam 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 or 2 . 0 mg was given by the oral or i . m . routes to groups of volunteers and its effects compared .
6103707	2	254	Plasma concentrations of the drug were estimated by gas - liquid chromatography , in a smaller number of the subjects .
6103707	3	370	The most striking effect was sedation which increased with the dose , 2 mg producing deep sleep although the subjects could still be aroused .
6103707	4	511	The effects of i . m . administration were apparent earlier and sometimes lasted longer than those following oral administration .
6103707	5	638	Dizziness was less marked than sedation , but increased with the dose .
6103707	6	708	There was pain on i . m . injection of flunitrazepam significantly more often than with isotonic saline .
6103707	7	810	Plasma concentrations varied with dose and route and corresponded qualitatively with the subjective effects .
6103707	8	919	The drug was still present in measurable quantities after 24 h even with the smallest dose .
6133211	0	0	Possible teratogenicity of sulphasalazine .
6133211	1	43	Three infants , born of two mothers with inflammatory bowel disease who received treatment with sulphasalazine throughout pregnancy , were found to have major congenital anomalies .
6133211	2	222	In the singleton pregnancy , the mother had ulcerative colitis , and the infant , a male , had coarctation of the aorta and a ventricular septal defect .
6133211	3	371	In the twin pregnancy , the mother had Crohn ' s disease .
6133211	4	426	The first twin , a female , had a left Potter - type IIa polycystic kidney and a rudimentary left uterine cornu .
6133211	5	535	The second twin , a male , had some features of Potter ' s facies , hypoplastic lungs , absent kidneys and ureters , and talipes equinovarus .
6133211	6	670	Despite reports to the contrary , it is suggested that sulphasalazine may be teratogenic .
6203452	0	0	Thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy .
6203452	1	90	Five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy ( characterized by renal insufficiency , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , and usually thrombocytopenia ) after treatment with cisplatin , bleomycin , and a vinca alkaloid .
6203452	2	325	One patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , three the hemolytic - uremic syndrome , and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders .
6203452	3	475	Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation , primarily affecting the small arteries , arterioles , and glomeruli .
6203452	4	631	Because each patient was tumor - free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome , the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemotherapy .
6203452	5	794	Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined , because renal failure may be ascribed to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug - induced bone marrow suppression .
6209318	0	0	International mexiletine and placebo antiarrhythmic coronary trial : I . Report on arrhythmia and other findings .
6209318	1	112	Impact Research Group .
6209318	2	135	The antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of mexiletine ( Mexitil - Perlongets ) were evaluated in a double - blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented myocardial infarction .
6209318	3	336	The primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording .
6209318	4	697	Large differences , regarded as statistically significant , between the mexiletine and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4 , but only trends were observed at month 12 .
6209318	5	888	These differences were observed even though the serum mexiletine levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the drug .
6209318	6	1080	There were more deaths in the mexiletine group ( 7 . 6 % ) than in the placebo group ( 4 . 8 % ) ; the difference was not statistically significant .
6209318	7	1218	The incidence of coronary events was similar in both groups .
6209318	8	1279	Previously recognized side effects , particularly tremor and gastrointestinal problems , were more frequent in the mexiletine group than in the placebo group .
6229975	0	0	Changes in heart size during long - term timolol treatment after myocardial infarction .
6229975	1	86	The effect of long - term timolol treatment on heart size after myocardial infarction was evaluated by X - ray in a double - blind study including 241 patients ( placebo 126 , timolol 115 ) .
6229975	2	268	The follow - up period was 12 months .
6229975	3	304	The timolol - treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group .
6229975	4	449	These differences may be caused by timolol - induced bradycardia and a compensatory increase in end - diastolic volume .
6229975	5	565	The timolol - related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size .
6229975	6	677	In patients with cardiomegaly , the increase in heart size was similar in both groups .
6229975	7	763	After re - infarction , heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the timolol group .
6286738	0	0	Vitamin D3 toxicity in dairy cows .
6286738	1	35	Large parenteral doses of vitamin D3 ( 15 to 17 . 5 x 10 ( 6 ) IU vitamin D3 ) were associated with prolonged hypercalcemia , hyperphosphatemia , and large increases of vitamin D3 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows .
6286738	2	300	Calcium concentrations 1 day postpartum were higher in cows treated with vitamin D3 about 32 days prepartum ( 8 . 8 mg / 100 ml ) than in control cows ( 5 . 5 mg / 100 ml ) .
6286738	3	462	None of the cows treated with vitamin D3 showed signs of milk fever during the peripartal period ; however , 22 % of the control cows developed clinical signs of milk fever during this period .
6286738	4	652	Signs of vitamin D3 toxicity were not observed in nonlactating nonpregnant cows ; however , pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of vitamin D3 toxicity and 10 of 17 cows died .
6286738	5	835	There was widespread metastatic calcification in the cows that died .
6286738	6	904	Because of the extreme toxicity of vitamin D3 in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of vitamin D3 that prevent milk fever and doses that induce milk fever , we concluded that vitamin D3 cannot be used practically to prevent milk fever when injected several weeks prepartum .
6287825	0	0	Diseases of peripheral nerves as seen in the Nigerian African .
6287825	1	63	The anatomical and aetiological diagnoses of peripheral nerve disease excluding its primary benign and malignant disorders , as seen in 358 Nigerians are presented .
6287825	2	227	There is a male preponderance and the peak incidence is in the fourth decade .
6287825	3	305	Sensori - motor neuropathy was the commonest presentation ( 50 % ) .
6287825	4	368	Guillain - Barr syndrome was the commonest identifiable cause ( 15 . 6 % ) , accounting for half of the cases with motor neuropathy .
6287825	5	495	Peripheral neuropathy due to nutritional deficiency of thiamine and riboflavin was common ( 10 . 1 % ) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori - motor neuropathy .
6287825	6	655	Diabetes mellitus was the major cause of autonomic neuropathy .
6287825	7	718	Isoniazid was the most frequent agent in drug - induced neuropathy .
6287825	8	784	Migraine ( 20 % ) was not an uncommon cause of cranial neuropathy although malignancies arising from the reticuloendothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more frequent ( 26 % ) .
6287825	9	982	In 26 . 5 % of all the cases , the aetiology of the neuropathy was undetermined .
6287825	10	1059	Heredofamilial and connective tissue disorders were rare .
6287825	11	1117	Some of the factors related to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of the neuropathies are briefly discussed .
6308277	0	0	Reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen .
6308277	1	49	A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over - the - counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate , caffeine , and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum .
6308277	2	300	Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS , attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen ( 52 micrograms / mL ) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine .
6308277	3	531	Studies in DBA / 2J mice showed that : 1 ) pretreatment with acetaminophen ( 100 mg / kg ) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine ( 300 to 450 mg / kg IP ) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two ; and 2 ) pretreatment with acetaminophen ( 75 mg / kg ) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine ( 12 . 5 to 75 mg / kg IP ) .
6308277	4	914	The frequency of sound - induced seizures after 12 . 5 or 25 mg / kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5 % by acetaminophen .
6308277	5	1030	In the absence of caffeine , acetaminophen ( up to 300 mg / kg ) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice ( tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS ) .
6308277	6	1286	Acetaminophen ( up to 150 micrograms / mL ) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive adenosine into ATP in slices of rat cerebral cortex .
6308277	7	1427	Thus the mechanism by which acetaminophen antagonizes the actions of caffeine in the CNS remains unknown .
6386793	0	0	A double - blind study of the efficacy and safety of dothiepin hydrochloride in the treatment of major depressive disorder .
6386793	1	122	In a 6 - week double - blind parallel treatment study , dothiepin and amitriptyline were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 depressed outpatients .
6386793	2	272	Dothiepin and amitriptyline were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of depressive illness , and both were significantly superior to placebo .
6386793	3	423	The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of blurred vision , dry mouth , and drowsiness were significantly less with dothiepin than with amitriptyline .
6386793	4	601	Dothiepin also produced fewer CNS and cardiovascular effects .
6386793	5	663	There were no clinically important changes in laboratory parameters .
6386793	6	732	Dothiepin thus was found to be an effective antidepressant drug associated with fewer side effects than amitriptyline in the treatment of depressed outpatients .
6387529	0	0	Behavioral effects of diazepam and propranolol in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia .
6387529	1	96	The effects of oral doses of diazepam ( single dose of 10 mg and a median dose of 30 mg / day for 2 weeks ) and propranolol ( single dose of 80 mg and a median dose of 240 mg / day for 2 weeks ) on psychological performance of patients with panic disorders and agoraphobia were investigated in a double - blind , randomized and crossover design .
6387529	2	431	Both drugs impaired immediate free recall but the decrease was greater for diazepam than propranolol .
6387529	3	533	Delayed free recall was also impaired but the two drugs did not differ .
6387529	4	605	Patients tapped faster after propranolol than diazepam and they were more sedated after diazepam than propranolol .
6387529	5	720	After 2 weeks of treatment , patients tested 5 - 8 h after the last dose of medication did not show any decrement of performance .
6387529	6	847	These results are similar to those previously found in healthy subjects .

6466532	0	0	Comparison of i . v . glycopyrrolate and atropine in the prevention of bradycardia and arrhythmias following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children .
6466532	1	151	The effectiveness of administration of glycopyrrolate 5 and 10 micrograms kg - 1 and atropine 10 and 20 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . immediately before the induction of anaesthesia , to prevent arrhythmia and bradycardia following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children , was studied .
6466532	2	429	A control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of glycopyrrolate and atropine .
6466532	3	531	A frequency of bradycardia of 50 % was noted in the control group , but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs .
6466532	4	680	Bradycardia ( defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min - 1 ) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used .
6466532	5	824	It is recommended that either glycopyrrolate 10 micrograms kg - 1 or atropine 20 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia , in children , if the repeated administration of suxamethonium is anticipated .
6503301	0	0	Veno - occlusive liver disease after dacarbazine therapy ( DTIC ) for melanoma .
6503301	1	76	A case of veno - occlusive disease of the liver with fatal outcome after dacarbazine ( DTIC ) therapy for melanoma is reported .
6503301	2	200	There was a fulminant clinical course from start of symptoms until death .
6503301	3	274	At autopsy the liver was enlarged and firm with signs of venous congestion .
6503301	4	350	Small - and medium - sized hepatic veins were blocked by thrombosis .
6503301	5	416	Eosinophilic infiltrations were found around the vessels .
6503301	6	474	Published cases from the literature are reviewed and pertinent features discussed .
6518066	0	0	Maternal lithium and neonatal Ebstein ' s anomaly : evaluation with cross - sectional echocardiography .
6518066	1	99	Cross - sectional echocardiography was used to evaluate two neonates whose mothers ingested lithium during pregnancy .
6518066	2	215	In one infant , Ebstein ' s anomaly of the tricuspid valve was identified .
6518066	3	287	In the other infant cross - sectional echocardiography provided reassurance that the infant did not have Ebstein ' s anomaly .
6518066	4	409	Cross - sectional echocardiographic screening of newborns exposed to lithium during gestation can provide highly accurate , noninvasive assessment of the presence or absence of lithium - induced cardiac malformations .
6534871	0	0	Effects of training on the extent of experimental myocardial infarction in aging rats .
6534871	1	87	The effects of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction were studied in female albino rats of 20 , 40 , 60 and 80 weeks of age .
6534871	2	242	The rats were trained to swim for a specific duration and for a particular period .
6534871	3	325	The occurrence of infarcts were confirmed by histological methods .
6534871	4	392	Elevations in the serum GOT and GPT were maximum in the sedentary - isoproterenols and minimum in the exercise - controls .
6534871	5	511	These changes in the serum transaminases were associated with corresponding depletions in the cardiac GOT and GPT .
6534871	6	626	However , age was seen to interfere with the responses exhibited by the young and old rats .
6534871	7	717	Studies dealing with myocardial infarction are more informative when dealt with age .
6538499	0	0	Effect of polyethylene glycol 400 on adriamycin toxicity in mice .
6538499	1	66	The effect of a widely used organic solvent , polyethylene glycol 400 ( PEG 400 ) , on the toxic action of an acute or chronic treatment with adriamycin ( ADR ) was evaluated in mice .
6538499	2	244	PEG 400 impressively decreased both acute high - dose and chronic low - dose - ADR - associated lethality .
6538499	3	343	Light microscopic analysis showed a significant protection against ADR - induced cardiac morphological alterations .
6538499	4	457	Such treatment did not diminish the ADR antitumor activity in L1210 leukemia and in Ehrlich ascites tumor .
6634932	0	0	Sublingual absorption of the quaternary ammonium antiarrhythmic agent , UM - 272 .
6634932	1	79	UM - 272 ( N , N - dimethylpropranolol ) , a quaternary antiarrhythmic agent , was administered sublingually to dogs with ouabain - induced ventricular tachycardias .
6634932	2	233	Both anti - arrhythmic efficacy and bioavailability were compared to oral drug .
6634932	3	311	Sublingual UM - 272 converted ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm in all 5 dogs .
6634932	4	394	The area under the plasma concentration time curve at 90 min was 4 - 12 times greater than for oral drug , suggesting the existence of an absorption - limiting process in the intestine , and providing an alternate form of administration for quaternary drugs .
6640832	0	0	Early adjuvant adriamycin in superficial bladder carcinoma .
6640832	1	60	A multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder .
6640832	2	171	Adriamycin ( 50 mg / 50 ml ) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA - T1 ( O - A ) bladder tumors .
6640832	3	301	Instillation was repeated twice during the first week , then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year .
6640832	4	426	The tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients , and 29 patients presented with local side - effects .
6640832	5	528	In 24 of these patients chemical cystitis was severe enough for them to drop out of the study .
6640832	6	623	No systemic side - effects were observed .
6640832	7	663	Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow - up and in 72 patients followed for 2 - 3 years ( mean 32 months ) .
6640832	8	797	Of the 82 patients studied after 1 year , 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease .
6640832	9	879	Of the 82 evaluable patients , 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year ( 61 % ) , while 32 presented with one or more recurrences ( 39 % ) .
6640832	10	1015	Of these recurrences , 27 were T1 tumors while five progressed to more highly invasive lesions .
6640832	11	1110	In patients that were free of recurrence during the first year , 80 % remained tumor - free during the 2 - to 3 - year follow - up period .
6640832	12	1240	Of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year , only 50 % presented with further recurrence once the instillations were stopped .
6640832	13	1394	The beneficial effect of Adriamycin appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself , the early and repeated instillations after TUR , or both .
6666578	0	0	D - penicillamine - induced angiopathy in rats .
6666578	1	44	The effect of high dose D - penicillamine treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel .
6666578	2	169	Male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated with D - penicillamine ( D - pen ) 500 mg / kg / day for 10 or 42 days .
6666578	3	269	Pair fed rats served as controls .
6666578	4	303	Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light - and transmission - electron microscopy ( TEM ) .
6666578	5	400	In addition , the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes , 24 and 48 hours after i . v . injection of human serum 131I - albumin ( 131I - HSA ) .
6666578	6	600	TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D - pen - treated rats , consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation .
6666578	7	740	In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall , together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells .
6666578	8	972	The aorta / serum - ratio and the radioactive build - up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I - HSA was reduced in animals treated with D - pen for 42 days , indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate .
6666578	9	1249	The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D - pen , and no differences in aortic 131I - HSA radioactivity or aorta / serum - ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection , indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D - pen treatment .
6666578	10	1578	These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of D - pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta , possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross - linking of collagen and elastin .
6692345	0	0	Effect of aspirin on N - [ 4 - ( 5 - nitro - 2 - furyl ) - 2 - thiazolyl ] - formamide - induced epithelial proliferation in the urinary bladder and forestomach of the rat .
6692345	1	151	The co - administration of aspirin with N - [ 4 - ( 5 - nitro - 2 - furyl ) - 2 - thiazolyl ] - formamide ( FANFT ) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of FANFT - induced bladder carcinomas but a concomitant induction of forestomach tumors .
6692345	2	370	An autoradiographic study was performed on male F - 344 rats fed diet containing FANFT at a level of 0 . 2 % and / or aspirin at a level of 0 . 5 % to evaluate the effect of aspirin on the increased cell proliferation induced by FANFT in the forestomach and bladder .
6692345	3	627	FANFT - induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by aspirin co - administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks .
6692345	4	771	In the forestomach , and also in the liver , aspirin did not affect the FANFT - induced increase in labeling index .
6692345	5	883	The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in FANFT carcinogenesis in the bladder and forestomach , and that aspirin ' s effect on FANFT in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation .
6692345	6	1193	Also , there appears to be an adaptation by the rats to the chronic ingestion of aspirin .
6727060	0	0	A case of tardive dyskinesia caused by metoclopramide .
6727060	1	55	Abnormal involuntary movements appeared in the mouth , tongue , neck and abdomen of a 64 - year - old male patient after he took metoclopramide for gastrointestinal disorder in a regimen of 30 mg per day for a total of about 260 days .
6727060	2	284	The symptoms exacerbated to a maximum in a month .
6727060	3	334	When the metoclopramide administration was discontinued , the abnormal movements gradually improved to a considerable extent .
6727060	4	459	Attention to the possible induction of specific tardive dyskinesia is called for in the use of this drug .
6747681	0	0	Intra - arterial BCNU chemotherapy for treatment of malignant gliomas of the central nervous system .
6747681	1	99	Because of the rapid systemic clearance of BCNU ( 1 , 3 - bis - ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - 1 - nitrosourea ) , intra - arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of malignant gliomas .
6747681	2	329	Thirty - six patients were treated with BCNU every 6 to 8 weeks , either by transfemoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable intracarotid drug delivery system , beginning with a dose of 200 mg / sq m body surface area .
6747681	3	597	Twelve patients with Grade III or IV astrocytomas were treated after partial resection of the tumor without prior radiation therapy .
6747681	4	730	After two to seven cycles of chemotherapy , nine patients showed a decrease in tumor size and surrounding edema on contrast - enhanced computerized tomography scans .
6747681	5	893	In the nine responders , median duration of chemotherapy response from the time of operation was 25 weeks ( range 12 to more than 91 weeks ) .
6747681	6	1032	The median duration of survival in the 12 patients was 54 weeks ( range 21 to more than 156 weeks ) , with an 18 - month survival rate of 42 % .
6747681	7	1170	Twenty - four patients with recurrent Grade I to IV astrocytomas , whose resection and irradiation therapy had failed , received two to eight courses of intra - arterial BCNU therapy .
6747681	8	1348	Seventeen of these had a response or were stable for a median of 20 weeks ( range 6 to more than 66 weeks ) .
6747681	9	1455	The catheterization procedure is safe , with no immediate complication in 111 infusions of BCNU .
6747681	10	1551	A delayed complication in nine patients has been unilateral loss of vision secondary to a retinal vasculitis .
6747681	11	1661	The frequency of visual loss decreased after the concentration of the ethanol diluent was lowered .
6773726	0	0	Provocation of postural hypotension by nitroglycerin in diabetic autonomic neuropathy ?
6773726	1	87	The effect of nitroglycerin on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was compared in 5 normal subjects , 12 diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy , and 5 diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy .
6773726	2	294	The magnitude and time course of the increase in heart rate and the decrease in systolic blood pressure after nitroglycerin were similar in the normal and diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy , whereas a lesser increase in heart rate and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in the diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy .
6773726	3	648	It is therefore suggested that caution should be exercised when prescribing vasodilator drugs in diabetic patients , particularly those with autonomic neuropathy .
6861444	0	0	Blood pressure response to chronic low - dose intrarenal noradrenaline infusion in conscious rats .
6861444	1	97	Sodium chloride solution ( 0 . 9 % ) or noradrenaline in doses of 4 , 12 and 36 micrograms h - 1 kg - 1 was infused for five consecutive days , either intrarenally ( by a new technique ) or intravenously into rats with one kidney removed .
6861444	2	323	Intrarenal infusion of noradrenaline caused hypertension at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously .
6861444	3	437	Intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused higher plasma noradrenaline concentrations and a shift of the plasma noradrenaline concentration - blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma noradrenaline levels .
6861444	4	675	These results suggest that hypertension after chronic intrarenal noradrenaline infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating noradrenaline and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism .
6888657	0	0	Characterization of estrogen - induced adenohypophyseal tumors in the Fischer 344 rat .
6888657	1	85	Pituitary tumors were induced in F344 female rats by chronic treatment with diethylstilbestrol ( DES , 8 - 10 mg ) implanted subcutaneously in silastic capsules .
6888657	2	242	Over a range of 1 - 150 days of DES treatment , pairs of control and DES - treated rats were sacrificed , and their pituitaries dissociated enzymatically into single - cell preparations .
6888657	3	421	The cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight , intracellular prolactin ( PRL ) content and subsequent release in primary culture , immunocytochemical PRL staining , density and / or size alterations via separation on Ficoll - Hypaque and by unit gravity sedimentation , and cell cycle analysis , after acriflavine DNA staining , by laser flow cytometry .
6888657	4	812	Total cell yields from DES - treated pituitaries increased from 1 . 3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 58 . 9 times control values by day 150 .
6888657	5	963	Intracellular PRL content ranged from 1 . 9 to 9 . 4 times control levels , and PRL release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls , after at least 8 days of DES exposure .
6888657	6	1155	Beyond 8 days of DES exposure , the immunochemically PRL - positive proportion of cells increased to over 50 % of the total population .
6888657	7	1287	Increased density and / or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols .
6888657	8	1431	All these effects of DES were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals .
6888657	9	1518	The data extend the findings of other investigators , further establishing the DES - induced tumor as a model for study of PRL cellular control mechanisms .
7053303	0	0	Age and renal clearance of cimetidine .
7053303	1	39	In 35 patients ( ages 20 to 86 yr ) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by high - pressure liquid chromatography and for creatinine .
7053303	2	265	Cimetidine clearance decreased with age .
7053303	3	306	The extrapolated 6 - hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose , after intravenous cimetidine , increased with age of the patients .
7053303	4	443	The ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance ( Rc ) averaged 4 . 8 + / - 2 . 0 , indicating net tubular secretion for cimetidine .
7053303	5	577	Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine , suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process .
7053303	6	741	There was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine ( with a drug level of 1 . 9 microgram / ml 6 hr after a dose ) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1 . 25 microgram / ml .
7053303	7	971	Thus , high cimetidine levels alone do not always induce dementia .
7083920	0	0	Further observations on the electrophysiologic effects of oral amiodarone therapy .
7083920	1	83	A case is presented of a reversible intra - Hisian block occurring under amiodarone treatment for atrial tachycardia in a patient without clear intraventricular conduction abnormalities .
7083920	2	268	His bundle recordings showed an atrial tachycardia with intermittent exit block and greatly prolonged BH and HV intervals ( 40 and 100 msec , respectively ) .
7083920	3	423	Thirty days after amiodarone discontinuation , His bundle electrograms showed atrial flutter without intra - Hisian or infra - Hisian delay .
7083920	4	559	Amiodarone should be used with caution during long - term oral therapy in patients with or without clear intraventricular conduction defects .
7088431	0	0	Development of clear cell adenocarcinoma in DES - exposed offspring under observation .
7088431	1	85	Two cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina detected at follow - up in young women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol are reported .
7088431	2	228	One patient , aged 23 , had been followed for 2 years before carcinoma was diagnosed ; the second patient , aged 22 , had been seen on a regular basis for 5 years , 8 months .
7088431	3	397	In both instances , suspicion of the presence of carcinoma was aroused by the palpation of a small nodule in the vaginal fornix .
7088431	4	525	Hysterosalpingography was performed on both patients and , in 1 instance , an abnormal x - ray film was reflected by the gross appearance of the uterine cavity found in the surgical specimen .
7199841	0	0	Neurologic effects of subarachnoid administration of 2 - chloroprocaine - CE , bupivacaine , and low pH normal saline in dogs .
7199841	1	121	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic consequences of deliberate subarachnoid injection of large volumes of 2 - chloroprocaine - CE in experimental animals .
7199841	2	293	The possible role of low pH as well as total volume as potential factors in causing neurotoxicity was evaluated .
7199841	3	406	The 65 dogs in the study received injections in the subarachnoid space as follows : 6 to 8 ml of bupivacaine ( N = 15 ) , 2 - chloroprocaine - CE ( N = 20 ) , low pH normal saline ( pH 3 . 0 ) ( N = 20 ) , or normal saline ( N = 10 ) .
7199841	4	621	Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of 2 - chloroprocaine - CE seven ( 35 % ) developed hind - limb paralysis .
7199841	5	742	None of the animals that received bupivacaine , normal saline , or normal saline titrated to a pH 3 . 0 developed hind - limb paralysis .
7199841	6	873	Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received 2 - chloroprocaine - CE , 13 showed subpial necrosis ; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal .
7199841	7	1028	The spinal cords of the animals that received bupivacaine , low pH normal saline ( pH 3 . 0 ) , or normal saline did not show abnormal findings .
7234705	0	0	Procainamide - induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia .
7234705	1	59	Seven cases of procainamide - induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia are presented .
7234705	2	147	In four patients , polymorphous ventricular tachycardia appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of procainamide for the treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia .
7234705	3	333	In the remaining three patients , procainamide was administered orally for treatment of chronic premature ventricular contractions or atrial flutter .
7234705	4	482	These patients had Q - T prolongation and recurrent syncope due to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia .
7234705	5	585	In four patients , the arrhythmia was rapidly diagnosed and treated with disappearance of further episodes of the arrhythmia .
7234705	6	710	In two patients , the arrhythmia degenerated into irreversible ventricular fibrillation and both patients died .
7234705	7	821	In the seventh patient , a permanent ventricular pacemaker was inserted and , despite continuation of procainamide therapy , polymorphous ventricular tachycardia did not reoccur .
7234705	8	997	These seven cases demonstrate that procainamide can produce an acquired prolonged Q - T syndrome with polymorphous ventricular tachycardia .
7248170	0	0	Phenobarbitone - induced enlargement of the liver in the rat : its relationship to carbon tetrachloride - induced cirrhosis .
7248170	1	120	The yield of severe cirrhosis of the liver ( defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology , ascites greater than 30 ml , plasma albumin less than 2 . 2 g / dl , splenomegaly 2 - 3 times normal , and testicular atrophy approximately half normal weight ) after 12 doses of carbon tetrachloride given intragastrically in the phenobarbitone - primed rat was increased from 25 % to 56 % by giving the initial " calibrating " dose of carbon tetrachloride at the peak of the phenobarbitone - induced enlargement of the liver .
7248170	2	645	At this point it was assumed that the cytochrome P450 / CCl4 toxic state was both maximal and stable .
7248170	3	745	The optimal rat size to begin phenobarbitone was determined as 100 g , and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47 % greater than normal rats of the same body weight .
7248170	4	944	The optimal time for the initial dose of carbon tetrachloride was after 14 days on phenobarbitone .
7265370	0	0	Triamterene nephrolithiasis complicating dyazide therapy .
7265370	1	58	A case of triamterene nephrolithiasis is reported in a man after 4 years of hydrochlorothiazide - triamterene therapy for hypertension .
7265370	2	192	The stone passed spontaneously and was found to contain a triamterene metabolite admixed with uric acid salts .
7265370	3	303	Factors affecting triamterene nephrolithiasis are discussed and 2 previously reported cases are reviewed .
7269015	0	0	Busulfan - induced hemorrhagic cystitis .
7269015	1	39	A case of a busulfan - induced hemorrhage cystitis is reported .
7269015	2	101	Spontaneous resolution occurred following cessation of the drug .
7269015	3	166	The similarity between the histologic appearances of busulfan cystitis and both radiation and cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis is discussed and the world literature reviewed .
7269015	4	342	In view of the known tendency of busulfan to induce cellular atypia and carcinoma in other sites , periodic urinary cytology is suggested in patients on long - term therapy .
7292072	0	0	Variant ventricular tachycardia in desipramine toxicity .
7292072	1	57	We report a case of variant ventricular tachycardia induced by desipramine toxicity .
7292072	2	142	Unusual features of the arrhythmia are repetitive group beating , progressive shortening of the R - R interval , progressive widening of the QRS complex with eventual failure of intraventricular conduction , and changes in direction of the QRS axis .
7292072	3	387	Recognition of variant ventricular tachycardia is important because therapy differs from that of classic ventricular tachycardia .
7352670	0	0	Rebound hypertensive after sodium nitroprusside prevented by saralasin in rats .
7352670	1	80	The role of the renin - - angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure during halothane anesthesia and sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) - induced hypotension was evaluated .
7352670	2	253	Control rats received halothane anesthesia ( 1 MAC ) for one hour , followed by SNP infusion , 40 microgram / kg / min , for 30 min , followed by a 30 - min recovery period .
7352670	3	415	A second group of rats was treated identically and , in addition , received an infusion of saralasin ( a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II ) throughout the experimental period .
7352670	4	594	In each group , SNP infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr , respectively , to 48 torr .
7352670	5	724	During the SNP infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive increase in blood pressure to 61 torr , whereas the saralasin - treated animals showed no change .
7352670	6	890	Following discontinuation of SNP , blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr , as compared with 78 torr in the saralasin - treated rats .
7352670	7	1040	This study indicates that with stable halothane anesthesia , the partial recovery of blood pressure during SNP infusion and the post - SNP rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by saralasin .
7352670	8	1242	This demonstrates the participation of the renin - - angiotensin system in antagonizing the combined hypotensive effects of halothane and SNP .
7420681	0	0	Clinical nephrotoxicity of tobramycin and gentamicin .
7420681	1	54	A prospective study .
7420681	2	75	Nearly 3 . 2 million people in this country receive aminoglycoside antibiotics annually .
7420681	3	162	Gentamicin sulfate and tobramycin sulfate continue to demonstrate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in both animal and clinical studies .
7420681	4	296	In this study , 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg / kg / day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside - related renal failure , defined as at least a one - third reduction in renal function .
7420681	5	627	In these 62 patients , no other causes for renal failure could be identified .
7420681	6	704	Five of 33 ( 15 % ) of the tobramycin - treated patients and 16 of 29 ( 55 . 2 % ) of the gentamicin - treated patients had renal failure .
7420681	7	831	Thus , gentamicin was associated with renal failure more than three times as often as was tobramycin .
7423039	0	0	Metabolic involvement in adriamycin cardiotoxicity .
7423039	1	52	The cardiotoxic effects of adriamycin were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system .
7423039	2	163	Adriamycin inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture .
7423039	3	273	A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously , and in this study the adenylate energy charge and phosphorylcreatine mole fraction were determined in the adriamycin - treated cells .
7423039	4	475	The adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased , while the phophorylcreatine mole fraction was unchanged .
7423039	5	601	Such disparity suggests an inhibition of creatine phosphokinase .
7423039	6	666	The addition of 1 mM adenosine to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the ATP concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized ATP pool .
7423039	7	840	In the adriamycin - treated cells , the addition of adenosine increased the adenylate charge and , concomitant with this inrcease , the cells ' functional integrity , in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions , was maintained .
7444978	0	0	Age - dependent sensitivity of the rat to neurotoxic effects of streptomycin .
7444978	1	76	Streptomycin sulfate ( 300 mg / kg s . c . ) was injected for various periods into preweanling rats and for 3 weeks into weanling rats .
7444978	2	205	Beginning at 8 days of age , body movement and hearing were examined for 6 and up to 17 weeks , respectively .
7444978	3	313	Abnormal movements and deafness occurred only in rats treated during the preweaning period ; within this period the greatest sensitivities for these abnormalities occurred from 2 to 11 - 17 and 5 to 11 days of age , respectively , indicating that the cochlea is more sensitive to streptomycin than the site ( vestibular or central ) responsible for the dyskinesias .
7449470	0	0	Late , late doxorubicin cardiotoxicity .
7449470	1	39	Cardiac toxicity is a major complication which limits the use of adriamycin as a chemotherapeutic agent .
7449470	2	144	Cardiomyopathy is frequent when the total dose exceeds 600 mg / m2 and occurs within one to six months after cessation of therapy .
7449470	3	273	A patient is reported who developed progressive cardiomyopathy two and one - half years after receiving 580 mg / m2 which apparently represents late , late cardiotoxicity .
7453952	0	0	Attenuation of the lithium - induced diabetes - insipidus - like syndrome by amiloride in rats .
7453952	1	90	The effect of amiloride on lithium - induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma , brain , kidney , thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats , chronically treated with LiCl .
7453952	2	305	Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute ( 6 or 12 h ) and a subacute ( 3 days ) experiment . 6 h after the administration of amiloride , a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied .
7453952	3	570	At 12 h , all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels .
7453952	4	639	After 3 days of combined treatment , a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake .
7453952	5	771	In all the experiments , the attenuation of the lithium - induced diabetes - insipidus - like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level .
7453952	6	1055	It is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium - treated patients suffering from polydipsia and polyuria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated lithium levels and might be hazardous .
7468724	0	0	Cardiovascular complications associated with terbutaline treatment for preterm labor .
7468724	1	86	Severe cardiovascular complications occurred in eight of 160 patients treated with terbutaline for preterm labor .
7468724	2	200	Associated corticosteroid therapy and twin gestations appear to be predisposing factors .
7468724	3	289	Potential mechanisms of the pathophysiology are briefly discussed .
7504976	0	0	Toxic hepatitis induced by antithyroid drugs : four cases including one with cross - reactivity between carbimazole and benzylthiouracil .
7504976	1	135	OBJECTIVE : This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with antithyroid drugs .
7504976	2	259	METHODS : Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department ( in - or out - patients ) from 1986 to 1992 .
7504976	3	413	RESULTS : Four patients ( 1 . 7 % ) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent .
7504976	4	550	Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole ( N omercazole ) .
7504976	5	631	Two others had a mixed ( cholestatic and cytolytic ) hepatitis following carbimazole .
7504976	6	715	One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after Benzylthiouracil ( Basd ne ) had replaced carbimazole .
7504976	7	863	Biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug , while biliary , viral and immunological searches were negative .
7504976	8	1026	Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia .
7504976	9	1111	CONCLUSION : Toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants , as for haematological disturbances , a pre - therapeutic determination and a careful follow - up of relevant biological markers .
7504976	10	1330	Moreover , hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents .
7516729	0	0	Interactive effects of variations in [ Na ] o and [ Ca ] o on rat atrial spontaneous frequency .
7516729	1	90	The effects of varying the extracellular concentrations of Na and Ca ( [ Na ] o and [ Ca ] o ) on both , the spontaneous beating and the negative chronotropic action of verapamil , were studied in the isolated rat atria .
7516729	2	301	Basal frequency ( BF ) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 + / - 4 beats / min . in control Krebs - Ringer containing 137 mM Na and 1 . 35 mM Ca ( N ) .
7516729	3	445	It decreased by 16 + / - 3 % by lowering [ Na ] o to 78 mM ( LNa ) , 23 + / - 2 % by lowering simultaneously [ Na ] o to 78 mM and [ Ca ] o to 0 . 675 mM ( LNa + LCa ) and 31 + / - 5 % by lowering [ Na ] o to 78 mM plus increasing [ Ca ] o to 3 . 6 mM ( LNa + HCa ) .
7516729	4	673	At normal [ Na ] o , decrease ( 0 . 675 mM ) or increase ( 3 . 6 mM ) of [ Ca ] o did not modify BF ; a reduction of ten times ( 0 . 135 mM of normal [ Ca ] o was effective to reduce BF by 40 + / - 13 % .
7516729	5	852	All negative chronotropic effects were BF - dependent .
7516729	6	905	Dose - dependent bradycardia induced by verapamil was potentiated by LNa , LCa , and HCa .
7516729	7	991	Independent but not additive effects of Na and Ca are shown by decreases in the values of [ verapamil ] o needed to reduce BF by 30 % ( IC30 ) with the following order of inhibitory potency : LNa > LCa > HCa > N , resulting LNa + HCa similar to LNa .
7516729	8	1231	The [ verapamil ] o that arrested atrial beating ( AC ) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa + LCa = LNa + HCa = LCa > HCa = N .
7516729	9	1359	The results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [ Na ] o than on [ Ca ] o in a range of + / - 50 % of their normal concentration .
7516729	10	1510	Also the enhancement of verapamil effects on atrial beating was more pronounced at LNa than at LCa . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
7582165	0	0	Pseudo - allergic reactions to corticosteroids : diagnosis and alternatives .
7582165	1	74	Two patients treated with parenteral paramethasone ( Triniol ) and dexamethasone ( Sedionbel ) are described .
7582165	2	180	A few minutes after administration of the drugs , they presented urticaria ( patients 1 and 2 ) and conjunctivitis ( patient 1 ) .
7582165	3	305	The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients ' reactions , the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid .
7582165	4	499	Clinical examinations and skin , oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed .
7582165	5	625	In the two patients , skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative , as was the prick test with each of its excipients .
7582165	6	752	A single - blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug , and negative with its excipients .
7582165	7	911	We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them .
7582165	8	1028	These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients .
7582165	9	1118	Corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients ; however , a few of them were tolerated .
7582165	10	1262	The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood .
7582165	11	1332	To our knowledge , this is the first report of a pseudo - allergy caused by paramethasone .
7628595	0	0	Study of the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing hematologic toxicity of zidovudine .
7628595	1	116	A prospective , randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing zidovudine ( ZDV ) - induced bone marrow suppression .
7628595	2	295	Seventy - five human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - infected patients with CD4 + cell counts < 500 / mm3 were randomized to receive either ZDV ( 500 mg daily ) alone ( group I , n = 38 ) or in combination with folinic acid ( 15 mg daily ) and intramascular vitamin B12 ( 1000 micrograms monthly ) ( group II , n = 37 ) .
7628595	3	596	Finally , 15 patients were excluded from the study ( noncompliance 14 , death 1 ) ; thus , 60 patients ( 31 in group I and 29 in group II ) were eligible for analysis .
7628595	4	756	No significant differences between groups were found at enrollment .
7628595	5	824	During the study , vitamin B12 and folate levels were significantly higher in group II patients ; however , no differences in hemoglobin , hematocrit , mean corpuscular volume , and white - cell , neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months .
7628595	6	1098	Severe hematologic toxicity ( neutrophil count < 1000 / mm3 and / or hemoglobin < 8 g / dl ) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group I and 7 assigned to group II .
7628595	7	1254	There was no correlation between vitamin B12 or folate levels and development of myelosuppression .
7628595	8	1353	Vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation of ZDV therapy does not seem useful in preventing or reducing ZDV - induced myelotoxicity in the overall treated population , although a beneficial effect in certain subgroups of patients cannot be excluded .
7802851	0	0	Safety and side - effects of alprazolam .
7802851	1	39	Controlled study in agoraphobia with panic disorder .
7802851	2	92	BACKGROUND : The widespread use of benzodiazepines has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects .
7802851	3	203	The efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic disorder with agoraphobia , and the side - effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured .
7802851	4	361	METHOD : In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM - III criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo .
7802851	5	507	Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation .
7802851	6	580	Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16 .
7802851	7	653	RESULTS : Mean alprazolam dose was 5 mg daily .
7802851	8	699	Compared with placebo subjects , alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions ( 21 % v . 0 % ) of depression , enuresis , disinhibition and aggression ; and more side - effects , particularly sedation , irritability , impaired memory , weight loss and ataxia .
7802851	9	952	Side - effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8 .
7802851	10	1037	Despite this , the drop - out rate was low .
7802851	11	1078	CONCLUSIONS : Alprazolam caused side - effects and adverse effects during treatment but many patients were willing to accept these .
7834920	0	0	Crescentic fibrillary glomerulonephritis associated with intermittent rifampin therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis .
7834920	1	115	This case study reveals an unusual finding of rapidly proliferative crescentic glomerulonephritis in a patient treated with rifampin who had no other identifiable causes for developing this disease .
7834920	2	314	This patient underwent a 10 - month regimen of rifampin and isoniazid for pulmonary tuberculosis and was discovered to have developed signs of severe renal failure five weeks after completion of therapy .
7834920	3	516	Renal biopsy revealed severe glomerulonephritis with crescents , electron dense fibrillar deposits and moderate lymphocytic interstitial infiltrate .
7834920	4	664	Other possible causes of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis were investigated and ruled out .
7834920	5	761	This report documents the unusual occurrence of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescents and fibrillar glomerulonephritis in a patient treated with rifampin .
7858459	0	0	Acute confusion induced by a high - dose infusion of 5 - fluorouracil and folinic acid .
7858459	1	84	A 61 - year - old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum , etoposide , high - dose 5 - fluorouracil ( 2 , 250 mg / m2 / 24 hours ) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma .
7858459	2	289	He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion , disorientation and irritability , and then lapsed into a deep coma , lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose ( day 2 ) of 5 - fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion .
7858459	3	526	This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5 - fluorouracil and folinic acid , which were then the only drugs given .
7858459	4	662	Because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition , neurotoxicity due to high - dose 5 - fluorouracil was highly suspected .
7858459	5	802	The pathogenesis of 5 - fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate , thiamine deficiency , or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency .
7858459	6	988	High - dose 5 - fluorouracil / folinic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancers .
7858459	7	1102	It is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication .
7862923	0	0	Effect of switching carbamazepine to oxcarbazepine on the plasma levels of neuroleptics .
7862923	1	89	A case report .
7862923	2	104	Carbamazepine was switched to its 10 - keto analogue oxcarbazepine among six difficult - to - treat schizophrenic or organic psychotic patients using concomitantly haloperidol , chlorpromazine or clozapine .
7862923	3	304	This change resulted within 2 - 4 weeks in the 50 - 200 % increase in the plasma levels of these neuroleptics and the appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms .
7862923	4	456	None of the patients showed any clinical deteriotation during the following 3 - 6 months .
7862923	5	544	The results of this case report support the idea that in contrast with carbamazepine oxcarbazepine does not induce the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems regulating the inactivation of antipsychotic drugs .
7881871	0	0	Time course of lipid peroxidation in puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephropathy .
7881871	1	84	Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) - induced nephropathy , with antioxidants significantly reducing the proteinuria .
7881871	2	269	The temporal relationship between lipid peroxidation in the kidney and proteinuria was examined in this study .
7881871	3	380	Rats were treated with a single IV injection of puromycin aminonucleoside , ( PAN , 7 . 5 mg / kg ) and 24 hour urine samples were obtained prior to sacrifice on days 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 17 , 27 , 41 ( N = 5 - 10 per group ) .
7881871	4	579	The kidneys were removed , flushed with ice cold TRIS buffer .
7881871	5	640	Kidney cortices from each animal were used to prepare homogenates .
7881871	6	707	Tissue lipid peroxidation was measured in whole homogenates as well as in lipid extracts from homogenates as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances .
7881871	7	857	Proteinuria was evident at day 5 , peaked at day 7 and persisted to day 27 .
7881871	8	932	Lipid peroxidation in homogenates was maximal at day 3 and declined rapidly to control levels by day 17 .
7881871	9	1037	This study supports the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating the proteinuric injury in PAN nephropathy .
7890216	0	0	Composition of gall bladder stones associated with octreotide : response to oral ursodeoxycholic acid .
7890216	1	102	Octreotide , an effective treatment for acromegaly , induces gall bladder stones in 13 - 60 % of patients .
7890216	2	204	Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis , treatment , and prevention , this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegalic patients with gall stones .
7890216	3	435	Chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients , showed that they contained 71 % and 87 % cholesterol by weight .
7890216	4	578	In the remaining 12 patients , localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units ( values of < 100 HU predict cholesterol rich , dissolvable stones ) .
7890216	5	812	Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided , fine needle puncture from six patients .
7890216	6	905	All six patients had supersaturated bile ( mean ( SEM ) cholesterol saturation index of 1 . 19 ( 0 . 08 ) ( range 1 . 01 - 1 . 53 ) ) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol microcrystal nucleation times ( < 4 days ( range 1 - 4 ) ) , whilst in four , the bile contained cholesterol microcrystals immediately after sampling .
7890216	7	1205	Of the 12 patients considered for oral ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) treatment , two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on UDCA while one was lost to follow up .
7890216	8	1375	After one year of treatment , five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial ( n = 3 ) or complete ( n = 2 ) gall stone dissolution , suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich .
7890216	9	1566	This corresponds , by actuarial ( life table ) analysis , to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58 . 3 ( 15 . 9 % ) .
7890216	10	1679	In conclusion , octreotide induced gall stones are generally small , multiple , and cholesterol rich although , in common with spontaneous gall stone disease , at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some gall stones containing calcium .
7919560	0	0	Erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin .
7919560	1	75	OBJECTIVE : To report a case of erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin .
7919560	2	181	CASE SUMMARY : A 13 - year - old boy was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin because of suspected septicemia .
7919560	3	289	Medications were discontinued when erythema multiforme and congestive heart failure caused by myocarditis occurred .
7919560	4	405	The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and gradually improved .
7919560	5	477	Macrophage - migration inhibition ( MIF ) test with ampicillin was positive .
7919560	6	550	DISCUSSION : After most infections causing erythema multiforme and myocarditis were ruled out , a drug - induced allergic reaction was suspected .
7919560	7	692	Positive MIF test for ampicillin showed sensitization of the patient ' s lymphocytes to ampicillin .
7919560	8	790	CONCLUSIONS : Hypersensitivity myocarditis is a rare and dangerous manifestation of allergy to penicillins .
7930386	0	0	Clomipramine - induced sleep disturbance does not impair its prolactin - releasing action .
7930386	1	87	The present study was undertaken to examine the role of sleep disturbance , induced by clomipramine administration , on the secretory rate of prolactin ( PRL ) in addition to the direct drug effect .
7930386	2	282	Two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo - controlled conditions , one during the night , when sleeping ( n = 7 ) and the other at daytime , when awake ( n = 6 ) .
7930386	3	452	Each subject received a single 50 mg dose of clomipramine given orally 2 hours before blood collection .
7930386	4	556	Plasma PRL concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution procedure .
7930386	5	688	For both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in PRL secretion , acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding control values .
7930386	6	910	During the night clomipramine ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed REM sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wakefulness .
7930386	7	1078	As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies ( 46 + / - 19 % vs 34 + / - 10 % ) , it can be concluded that the observed sleep disturbance did not interfere with the drug action per se .
7930386	8	1357	The presence of REM sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency , as , for both , mean nocturnal values were similar with and without prior clomipramine ingestion .
7977601	0	0	Survey of complications of indocyanine green angiography in Japan .
7977601	1	67	PURPOSE : We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography .
7977601	2	152	METHODS : We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan , which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company , which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera .
7977601	3	393	RESULTS : Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded , reporting a total of 3 , 774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2 , 820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992 .
7977601	4	571	Before angiography , intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing , or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions .
7977601	5	693	For three patients , the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing .
7977601	6	807	The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg , depending upon the institution .
7977601	7	917	There were 13 cases of adverse reactions ( 0 . 34 % ) , ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea , exanthema , urtication , itchiness , and urgency to defecate , and did not require treatment .
7977601	8	1106	Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein , which required treatment , and two cases of hypotension .
7977601	9	1211	The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock .
7977601	10	1270	CONCLUSIONS : A comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to indocyanine green with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to fluorescein sodium indicated that indocyanine green is a safe as fluorescein for use in angiography .
7988234	0	0	Angioedema following the intravenous administration of metoprolol .
7988234	1	67	A 72 - year - old woman was admitted to the hospital with " flash " pulmonary edema , preceded by chest pain , requiring intubation .
7988234	2	192	Her medical history included coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarctions , hypertension , and diabetes mellitus .
7988234	3	320	A history of angioedema secondary to lisinopril therapy was elicited .
7988234	4	390	Current medications did not include angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or beta - blockers .
7988234	5	485	She had no previous beta - blocking drug exposure .
7988234	6	534	During the first day of hospitalization ( while intubated ) , intravenous metoprolol was given , resulting in severe angioedema .
7988234	7	659	The angioedema resolved after therapy with intravenous steroids and diphenhydramine hydrochloride .
8073369	0	0	Effect of coniine on the developing chick embryo .
8073369	1	50	Coniine , an alkaloid from Conium maculatum ( poison hemlock ) , has been shown to be teratogenic in livestock .
8073369	2	158	The major teratogenic outcome is arthrogryposis , presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade .
8073369	3	254	However , coniine has failed to produce arthrogryposis in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits .
8073369	4	367	The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of coniine and nicotine in the developing chick .
8073369	5	482	Concentrations of coniine and nicotine sulfate were 0 . 015 % , 0 . 03 % , 0 . 075 % , 0 . 15 % , 0 . 75 % , 1 . 5 % , 3 % , and 6 % and 1 % , 5 % , and 10 % , respectively .
8073369	6	623	Both compounds caused deformations and lethality in a dose - dependent manner .
8073369	7	700	All concentrations of nicotine sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for coniine lethality was 0 . 75 % .
8073369	8	816	The deformations caused by both coniine and nicotine sulfate were excessive flexion or extension of one or more toes .
8073369	9	934	No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group ; however , extensive cranial hemorrhage occurred in all nicotine sulfate - treated chicks .
8073369	10	1148	There was a statistically significant ( P < or = 0 . 01 ) decrease in movement in coniine and nicotine sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultrasound .
8073369	11	1299	Control chicks were in motion an average of 33 . 67 % of the time , while coniine - treated chicks were only moving 8 . 95 % of a 5 - min interval , and no movement was observed for nicotine sulfate treated chicks .
8073369	12	1502	In summary , the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of coniine - induced arthrogryposis .
8073369	13	1623	Data from this model support a mechanism involving nicotinic receptor blockade with subsequent decreased fetal movement .
8092427	0	0	Immediate allergic reactions to amoxicillin .
8092427	1	45	A large group of patients with suspected allergic reactions to beta - lactam antibiotics was evaluated .
8092427	2	147	A detailed clinical history , together with skin tests , RAST ( radioallergosorbent test ) , and controlled challenge tests , was used to establish whether patients allergic to beta - lactam antibiotics had selective immediate allergic responses to amoxicillin ( AX ) or were cross - reacting with other penicillin derivatives .
8092427	3	463	Skin tests were performed with benzylpenicilloyl - poly - L - lysine ( BPO - PLL ) , benzylpenicilloate , benzylpenicillin ( PG ) , ampicillin ( AMP ) , and AX .
8092427	4	606	RAST for BPO - PLL and AX - PLL was done .
8092427	5	644	When both skin test and RAST for BPO were negative , single - blind , placebo - controlled challenge tests were done to ensure tolerance of PG or sensitivity to AX .
8092427	6	803	A total of 177 patients were diagnosed as allergic to beta - lactam antibiotics .
8092427	7	882	We selected the 54 ( 30 . 5 % ) cases of immediate AX allergy with good tolerance of PG .
8092427	8	966	Anaphylaxis was seen in 37 patients ( 69 % ) , the other 17 ( 31 % ) having urticaria and / or angioedema .
8092427	9	1064	All the patients were skin test negative to BPO ; 49 of 51 ( 96 % ) were also negative to MDM , and 44 of 46 ( 96 % ) to PG .
8092427	10	1181	Skin tests with AX were positive in 34 ( 63 % ) patients .
8092427	11	1236	RAST was positive for AX in 22 patients ( 41 % ) and to BPO in just 5 ( 9 % ) .
8092427	12	1309	None of the sera with negative RAST for AX were positive to BPO .
8092427	13	1374	Challenge tests with AX were performed in 23 subjects ( 43 % ) to establish the diagnosis of immediate allergic reaction to AX , and in 15 cases ( 28 % ) both skin test and RAST for AX were negative .
8092427	14	1567	PG was well tolerated by all 54 patients .
8092427	15	1609	We describe the largest group of AX - allergic patients who have tolerated PG reported so far .
8092427	16	1702	Diagnosis of these patients can be achieved only if specific AX - related reagents are employed .
8092427	17	1797	Further studies are necessary to determine the exact extent of this problem and to improve the efficacy of diagnostic methods .
809711	0	0	Reversal by phenylephrine of the beneficial effects of intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction .
809711	1	127	Nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce ST - segment elevation during acute myocardial infarction , an effect potentiated in the dog by agents that reverse nitroglycerin - induced hypotension .
809711	2	314	Our study was designed to determine the effects of combined nitroglycerin and phenylephrine therapy .
809711	3	415	Ten patients with acute transmural myocardial infarctions received intravenous nitroglycerin , sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure from 107 + / - 6 to 85 + / - 6 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) , for 60 minutes .
809711	4	623	Left ventricular filling pressure decreased from 19 + / - 2 to 11 + / - 2 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
809711	5	720	SigmaST , the sum of ST - segment elevations in 16 precordial leads , decreased ( P less than 0 . 02 ) with intravenous nitroglycerin .
809711	6	847	Subsequent addition of phenylephrine infusion , sufficient to re - elevate mean arterial pressure to 106 + / - 4 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) for 30 minutes , increased left ventricular filling pressure to 17 + / - 2 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and also significantly increased sigmaST ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .
809711	7	1139	Our results suggest that addition of phenylephrine to nitroglycerin is not beneficial in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction .
8170551	0	0	Acetazolamide - induced nephrolithiasis : implications for treatment of neuromuscular disorders .
8170551	1	94	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can cause nephrolithiasis .
8170551	2	151	We studied 20 patients receiving long - term carbonic anhydrase inhibitor treatment for periodic paralysis and myotonia .
8170551	3	270	Three patients on acetazolamide ( 15 % ) developed renal calculi .
8170551	4	333	Extracorporeal lithotripsy successfully removed a renal calculus in one patient and surgery removed a staghorn calculus in another , permitting continued treatment .
8170551	5	497	Renal function remained normal in all patients .
8170551	6	545	Nephrolithiasis is a complication of acetazolamide but does not preclude its use .
8231633	0	0	Effects of calcium channel blockers on bupivacaine - induced toxicity .
8231633	1	69	The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of calcium channel blockers on bupivacaine - induced acute toxicity .
8231633	2	195	For each of the three tested calcium channel blockers ( diltiazem , verapamil and bepridil ) 6 groups of mice were treated by two different doses , i . e . 2 and 10 mg / kg / i . p . , or an equal volume of saline for the control group ( n = 20 ) ; 15 minutes later , all the animals were injected with a single 50 mg / kg / i . p . dose of bupivacaine .
8231633	3	523	The convulsant activity , the time of latency to convulse and the mortality rate were assessed in each group .
8231633	4	632	The local anesthetic - induced mortality was significantly increased by the three different calcium channel blockers .
8231633	5	748	The convulsant activity of bupivacaine was not significantly modified but calcium channel blockers decreased the time of latency to obtain bupivacaine - induced convulsions ; this effect was less pronounced with bepridil .
8302922	0	0	Epidural blood flow during prostaglandin E1 or trimethaphan induced hypotension .
8302922	1	81	To evaluate the effect of prostaglandin E1 ( PGE1 ) or trimethaphan ( TMP ) induced hypotension on epidural blood flow ( EBF ) during spinal surgery , EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero - lateral interbody fusion under isoflurane anaesthesia .
8302922	2	366	An initial dose of 0 . 1 microgram . kg - 1 . min - 1 of PGE1 ( 15 patients ) , or 10 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 of TMP ( 15 patients ) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) at about 60 mmHg .
8302922	3	632	The hypotensive drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative procedure .
8302922	4	716	After starting PGE1 or TMP , MAP and rate pressure product ( RPP ) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values ( P < 0 . 01 ) , and the degree of hypotension due to PGE1 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation .
8302922	5	949	Heart rate ( HR ) did not change in either group .
8302922	6	997	EBFF did not change during PGE1 infusion whereas in the TMP group , EBF decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of TMP ( preinfusion : 45 . 9 + / - 13 . 9 ml / 100g / min . 30 min : 32 . 3 + / - 9 . 9 ml / 100 g / min ( P < 0 . 05 ) . 60 min : 30 + / - 7 . 5 ml / 100 g / min ( P < 0 . 05 ) ) .
8302922	7	1264	These results suggest that PGE1 may be preferable to TMP for hypotensive anaesthesia in spinal surgery because TMP decreased EBF .
8319760	0	0	Dup 753 prevents the development of puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrosis .
8319760	1	81	The appearance of nephrotic syndromes such as proteinuria , hypoalbuminemia , hypercholesterolemia and increase in blood nitrogen urea , induced in rats by injection of puromycin aminonucleoside was markedly inhibited by oral administration of Dup 753 ( losartan ) , a novel angiotensin II receptor antagonist , at a dose of 1 or 2 mg / kg per day .
8319760	2	421	The results suggest a possible involvement of the renin - angiotensin system in the development of puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrosis .
8372922	0	0	Neuroplasticity of the adult primate auditory cortex following cochlear hearing loss .
8372922	1	86	Tonotopic organization is an essential feature of the primary auditory area ( A1 ) of primate cortex .
8372922	2	186	In A1 of macaque monkeys , low frequencies are represented rostrolaterally and high frequencies are represented caudomedially .
8372922	3	312	The purpose of this study was to determine if changes occur in this tonotopic organization following cochlear hearing loss .
8372922	4	436	Under anesthesia , the superior temporal gyrus of adult macaque monkeys was exposed , and the tonotopic organization of A1 was mapped using conventional microelectrode recording techniques .
8372922	5	624	Following recovery , the monkeys were selectively deafened for high frequencies using kanamycin and furosemide .
8372922	6	735	The actual frequencies deafened were determined by the loss of tone - burst elicited auditory brainstem responses .
8372922	7	848	Three months after deafening , A1 was remapped .
8372922	8	895	Postmortem cytoarchitectural features identifying A1 were correlated with the electrophysiologic data .
8372922	9	998	The results indicate that the deprived area of A1 undergoes extensive reorganization and becomes responsive to intact cochlear frequencies .
8372922	10	1138	The region of cortex that represents the low frequencies was not obviously affected by the cochlear hearing loss .
8386779	0	0	Sodium bicarbonate alleviates penile pain induced by intracavernous injections for erectile dysfunction .
8386779	1	105	In an attempt to determine whether penile pain associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication , we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of penile pain following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the intracorporeal medications .
8386779	2	434	A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0 . 2 ml . of a combination of 3 drugs : 6 mg . papaverine , 100 micrograms . phentolamine and 10 micrograms . prostaglandin E1 with ( pH 7 . 05 ) or without ( pH 4 . 17 ) the addition of sodium bicarbonate ( 0 . 03 mEq . ) .
8386779	3	725	Of the 19 patients without sodium bicarbonate added to the medication 11 ( 58 % ) complained of penile pain due to the medication , while only 1 of the 19 men ( 5 % ) who received sodium bicarbonate complained of penile pain .
8386779	4	944	From these data we conclude that the penile pain following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication , which can be overcome by elevating the pH to a neutral level .
8387218	0	0	The use and toxicity of didanosine ( ddI ) in HIV antibody - positive individuals intolerant to zidovudine ( AZT )
8387218	1	109	One hundred and fifty - one patients intolerant to zidovudine ( AZT ) received didanosine ( ddI ) to a maximum dose of 12 . 5 mg / kg / day .
8387218	2	238	Patient response was assessed using changes in CD4 + lymphocyte subset count , HIV p24 antigen , weight , and quality of life .
8387218	3	361	Seventy patients developed major opportunistic infections whilst on therapy ; this was the first AIDS diagnosis in 17 .
8387218	4	479	Only minor changes in CD4 + lymphocyte subset count were observed in AIDS patients , although a more significant rise occurred in those with earlier stages of disease .
8387218	5	645	Of those positive for p24 antigen at the commencement of the study 67 % showed a positive response , and this was most likely in those with CD4 + lymphocyte subset counts above 100 mm3 .
8387218	6	828	A positive weight response was seen in 16 % of patients .
8387218	7	884	Most patients showed improvement in individual parameters and global score of quality of life .
8387218	8	979	Adverse reactions possibly attributable to didanosine were common .
8387218	9	1046	The most common side - effect was diarrhoea , which resulted in cessation of therapy in 19 individuals .
8387218	10	1147	Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 12 patients and pancreatitis in six .
8387218	11	1218	Thirteen patients developed a raised serum amylase without abdominal pain .
8387218	12	1293	Seven patients developed glucose tolerance curves characteristic of diabetes but these were mild , did not require treatment and returned to normal on ceasing didanosine .
8410052	0	0	Immunohistochemical studies with antibodies to neurofilament proteins on axonal damage in experimental focal lesions in rat .
8410052	1	125	Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament ( NF ) proteins of middle and high molecular weight class , NF - M and NF - H , was used to study axonal injury in the borderzone of focal lesions in rats .
8410052	2	343	Focal injury in the cortex was produced by infusion of lactate at acid pH or by stab caused by needle insertion .
8410052	3	456	Infarcts in substantia nigra pars reticulata were evoked by prolonged pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus .
8410052	4	566	Immunohistochemical staining for NFs showed characteristic terminal clubs of axons in the borderzone of lesions .
8410052	5	679	Differences in the labelling pattern occurred with different antibodies which apparently depended on molecular weight class of NFs and phosphorylation state .
8410052	6	837	These immunohistochemical changes of NFs can serve as a marker for axonal damage in various experimental traumatic or ischemic lesions .
84204	0	0	Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in patients with cimetidine - associated mental confusion . 15 cases of cimetidine - associated mental confusion have been reported .
84204	1	165	In order that this syndrome might be investigated changes in mental status ( M . S . ) were correlated with serum concentrations and renal and hepatic function in 36 patients , 30 patients had no M . S . change on cimetidine and 6 had moderate to severe changes .
84204	2	419	These 6 patients had both renal and liver dysfunction ( P less than 0 . 05 ) , as well as cimetidine trough - concentrations of more than 1 . 25 microgram / ml ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .
84204	3	588	The severity of M . S . changes increased as trough - concentrations rose , 5 patients had lumbar puncture .
84204	4	690	The cerebrospinal fluid : serum ratio of cimetidine concentrations was 0 . 24 : 1 and indicates that cimetidine passes the blood - brain barrier ; it also raises the possibility that M . S . changes are due to blockade of histamine H2 - receptors in the central nervous system .
84204	5	955	Patients likely to have both raised trough - concentrations and mental confusion are those with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction .
84204	6	1092	They should be closely observed and should be given reduced doses of cimetidine .
8421099	0	0	Prospective study of the long - term effects of somatostatin analog ( octreotide ) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in Chinese acromegalic patients .
8421099	1	160	This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300 - 1500 micrograms / day for a mean of 24 . 2 + / - 13 . 9 months .
8421099	2	429	During treatment with octreotide , 17 patients developed sludge , 10 had gallstones , and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery .
8421099	3	567	In all of 7 patients examined acutely , gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100 - micrograms injection .
8421099	4	687	In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks , gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy .
8421099	5	789	After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones , 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month .
8421099	6	938	In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment , gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients ( 3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks ) , and remained depressed in 3 ( 2 of whom had stones present at 6 months ) .
8421099	7	1200	Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge , gallstones , and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in Chinese acromegalic patients .
8421099	8	1416	It is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long - term octreotide therapy of acromegalic patients .
8423889	0	0	Increase of Parkinson disability after fluoxetine medication .
8423889	1	62	Depression is a major clinical feature of Parkinson ' s disease .
8423889	2	125	We report the increased amount of motor disability in four patients with idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease after exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine .
8423889	3	278	The possibility of a clinically relevant dopamine - antagonistic capacity of fluoxetine in Parkinson ' s disease patients must be considered .
8437969	0	0	Sinus arrest associated with continuous - infusion cimetidine .
8437969	1	61	The administration of intermittent intravenous infusions of cimetidine is infrequently associated with the development of bradyarrhythmias .
8437969	2	201	A 40 - year - old man with leukemia and no history of cardiac disease developed recurrent , brief episodes of apparent sinus arrest while receiving continuous - infusion cimetidine 50 mg / hour .
8437969	3	387	The arrhythmias were temporally related to cimetidine administration , disappeared after dechallenge , and did not recur during ranitidine treatment .
8437969	4	535	This is the first reported case of sinus arrest associated with continuous - infusion cimetidine .
8558192	0	0	Phase II trial of vinorelbine in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma .
8558192	1	80	European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gastrointestinal Treat Cancer Cooperative Group .
8558192	2	188	PURPOSE : To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of vinorelbine ( VNB ) administered as a single agent in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma .
8558192	3	347	PATIENTS AND METHODS : Forty - six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy .
8558192	4	491	Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin - based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response .
8558192	5	629	VNB was administered weekly as a 25 - mg / m2 short intravenous ( i . v . ) infusion .
8558192	6	706	RESULTS : Six of 30 patients ( 20 % ) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response ( PR ) ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 8 % to 39 % ) .
8558192	7	843	The median duration of response was 21 weeks ( range , 17 to 28 ) .
8558192	8	907	One of 16 patients ( 6 % ) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response ( CR ) of 31 weeks ' duration ( 95 % CI , 0 % to 30 % ) .
8558192	9	1027	The overall response rate ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] criteria ) was 15 % ( CR , 2 % ; PR 13 % ; 95 % CI , 6 % to 29 % ) .
8558192	10	1141	The median dose - intensity ( DI ) was 20 mg / m2 / wk .
8558192	11	1189	VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred .
8558192	12	1280	At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59 % of patients .
8558192	13	1363	A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16 % of patients , but no toxic deaths occurred .
8558192	14	1447	Other side effects were rare , and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor ( 26 % grade 1 ) .
8558192	15	1536	CONCLUSION : These data indicate that VNB is an active agent in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma .
8558192	16	1646	Given its excellent tolerance profile and low toxicity , further evaluation of VNB in combination therapy is warranted .
8590259	0	0	Evaluation of adverse reactions of aponidine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution .
8590259	1	80	We prospectively evaluated the adverse reactions of apraclonidine in 20 normal volunteers by instilling a single drop of 1 % apraclonidine in their right eyes .
8590259	2	239	Examinations , including blood pressure , pulse rate , conjunctiva and cornea , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , pupil diameter , basal tear secretion and margin reflex distance of both upper and lower eyelids , were performed prior to entry and at 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 hours after instillation .
8590259	3	517	The ocular hypotensive effects were statistically significant for apraclonidine - treated eyes throughout the study and also statistically significant for contralateral eyes from three hours after topical administration of 1 % apraclonidine .
8590259	4	756	Decreases in systolic blood pressure were statistically , but not clinically , significant .
8590259	5	846	No significant changes in diastolic blood pressure , pulse rate and basal tear secretion were noted .
8590259	6	946	Conjunctival blanching and mydriasis were commonly found .
8590259	7	1004	Upper lid retraction was frequently noted .
8590259	8	1047	While the elevations of the upper lid margin in most subjects were not more than 2 mm and did not cause noticeable change in appearance , one subject suffered from mechanical entropion and marked corneal abrasion 3 hours after instillation of the medication .
8590259	9	1305	This may well be a particularly notable finding in Asian people .
8595686	0	0	Thiopentone pretreatment for propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients .
8595686	1	77	This study investigated propofol injection pain in patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia .
8595686	2	172	In a randomized , double - blind trial , 90 women were allocated to receive one of three treatments prior to induction of anaesthesia with propofol .
8595686	3	317	Patients in Group C received 2 ml normal saline , Group L , 2 ml , lidocaine 2 % ( 40 mg ) and Group T , 2 ml thiopentone 2 . 5 % ( 50 mg ) .
8595686	4	446	Venous discomfort was assessed with a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 5 - 15 sec after commencing propofol administration using an infusion pump ( rate 1000 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) .
8595686	5	620	Loss of consciousness occurred in 60 - 90 sec .
8595686	6	665	Visual analogue scores ( mean + / - SD ) during induction were lower in Groups L ( 3 . 3 + / - 2 . 5 ) and T ( 4 . 1 + / - 2 . 7 ) than in Group C ( 5 . 6 + / - 2 . 3 ) ; P = 0 . 0031 .
8595686	7	819	The incidence of venous discomfort was lower in Group L ( 76 . 6 % ; P < 0 . 05 ) than in Group C ( 100 % ) but not different from Group T ( 90 % ) .
8595686	8	954	The VAS scores for recall of pain in the recovery room were correlated with the VAS scores during induction ( r = 0 . 7045 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
8595686	9	1088	Recovery room discharge times were similar : C ( 75 . 9 + / - 19 . 4 min ) ; L 73 . 6 + / - 21 . 6 min ) ; T ( 77 . 1 + / - 18 . 9 min ) .
8595686	10	1200	Assessing their overall satisfaction , 89 . 7 % would choose propofol anaesthesia again .
8595686	11	1285	We conclude that lidocaine reduces the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients whereas thiopentone only reduces its severity .
8638206	0	0	Persistent paralysis after prolonged use of atracurium in the absence of corticosteroids .
8638206	1	90	Neuromuscular blocking agents ( NMBAs ) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation .
8638206	2	200	Reports of persistent paralysis after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid - based NMBAs such as vecuronium bromide , especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids .
8638206	3	408	Atracurium besylate , a short - acting benzylisoquinolinium NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function , has also been associated with persistent paralysis , but only when used with corticosteroids .
8638206	4	626	We report a case of atracurium - related paralysis persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids .
8643971	0	0	A phase I / II study of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as first - line therapy for head and neck cancers : preliminary results .
8643971	1	118	Improved outcomes among patients with head and neck carcinomas require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy .
8643971	2	240	Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single - agent paclitaxel ( Taxol ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) reported a 37 % response rate in patients with head and neck cancer , and the paclitaxel / cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients .
8643971	3	607	We initiated a phase I / II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed - dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony - stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma .
8643971	4	875	To date , 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial .
8643971	5	973	Primary tumor sites were oropharynx , 10 patients ; hypopharynx , four ; larynx , two ; oral cavity , three ; unknown primary , two ; and nasal cavity and parotid gland , one each .
8643971	6	1143	Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity , four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease .
8643971	7	1230	Treatment , given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles , consisted of paclitaxel by 3 - hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin ( 75 mg / m2 ) .
8643971	8	1398	The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses , and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits .
8643971	9	1545	At the time of this writing , dose level 4 ( 260 , 270 , and 280 mg / m2 ) is being evaluated ; three patients from this level are evaluable .
8643971	10	1679	With paclitaxel doses of 200 mg / m2 and higher , granulocyte colony - stimulating factor 5 micrograms / kg / d is given ( days 4 through 12 ) .
8643971	11	1812	Of 18 patients evaluable for response , seven ( 39 % ) achieved a complete response and six ( 33 % ) achieved a partial response .
8643971	12	1935	Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two .
8643971	13	1995	The overall response rate is 72 % .
8643971	14	2029	Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery / radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy .
8643971	15	2117	Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses .
8643971	16	2223	Alopecia , paresthesias , and arthralgias / myalgias have occurred frequently , but with one exception ( a grade 3 myalgia ) they have been grade 1 or 2 .
8643971	17	2370	No dose - limiting hematologic toxicity has been seen .
8643971	18	2423	Paclitaxel / cisplatin is an effective first - line regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and continued study is warranted .
8643971	19	2562	Results thus far suggest no dose - response effect for paclitaxel doses above 200 mg / m2 .
8649546	0	0	Improvement of levodopa - induced dyskinesia by propranolol in Parkinson ' s disease .
8649546	1	82	Seven patients suffering from Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) with severely disabling dyskinesia received low - dose propranolol as an adjunct to the currently used medical treatment .
8649546	2	257	There was a significant 40 % improvement in the dyskinesia score without increase of parkinsonian motor disability .
8649546	3	372	Ballistic and choreic dyskinesia were markedly ameliorated , whereas dystonia was not .
8649546	4	458	This study suggests that administration of low doses of beta - blockers may improve levodopa - induced ballistic and choreic dyskinesia in PD .
8669433	0	0	Habitual use of acetaminophen as a risk factor for chronic renal failure : a comparison with phenacetin .
8669433	1	104	Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19 .
8669433	2	345	As a result of these and other studies , phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries .
8669433	3	454	However , three case control studies , one each in North Carolina , northern Maryland , and West Berlin , Germany , showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD , with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4 .
8669433	4	707	These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD , with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former .
8669433	5	879	This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves .
8669433	6	992	A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone .
8669433	7	1161	Thus , acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics , whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations .
8669433	8	1315	The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of ESRD has not been clearly demonstrated , but cannot be dismissed .
8682684	0	0	Acetaminophen - induced hypotension .
8682684	1	35	Through 30 years of widespread use , acetaminophen has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages .
8682684	2	159	The potential for acetaminophen to produce cardiovascular toxicities is very low .
8682684	3	241	However , acetaminophen has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of anaphylaxis , including hypotension , in sensitive individuals .
8682684	4	371	This article describes two critically ill patients in whom transient episodes of hypotension reproducibly developed after administration of acetaminophen .
8682684	5	526	Other symptoms of allergic reactions were not clinically detectable .
8682684	6	595	The hypotensive episodes were severe enough to require vasopressor administration .
8682684	7	678	The reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider acetaminophen in patients with hypotension of unknown origin .
8690168	0	0	Reduction of heparan sulphate - associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy .
8690168	1	149	Heparan sulphate - associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin and in age - adn sex - matched control rats , employing the cationic dye cuprolinic blue .
8690168	2	389	Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor .
8690168	3	492	The heparan sulphate specificity of the cuprolinic blue staining was demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan - degrading enzymes , showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining , whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect .
8690168	4	740	The majority of anionic sites ( 74 % in diabetic and 81 % in control rats ) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane .
8690168	5	891	A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna , and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane ( p < 0 . 001 and p < 0 . 01 for diabetic and control rats , respectively ) .
8690168	6	1158	Diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40 . 3 ( 32 . 2 - 62 . 0 ) mg / 24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals ( 0 . 8 ( 0 . 2 - 0 . 9 ) mg / 24 h , p < 0 . 002 ) .
8690168	7	1326	At the same time , the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface ( number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface ) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19 % ( p < 0 . 021 ) and by 26 % ( p < 0 . 02 ) , respectively .
8690168	8	1605	Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane ( lamina densa and lamina rara interna ) were not significantly changed .
8690168	9	1772	We conclude that in streptozotocin - diabetic rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion , a reduced heparan sulphate charge barrier / density is found at the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane .
869641	0	0	Mediation of enhanced reflex vagal bradycardia by L - dopa via central dopamine formation in dogs .
869641	1	97	L - Dopa ( 5 mg / kg i . v . ) decreased blood pressure and heart rate after extracerebral decarboxylase inhibition with MK - 486 ( 25 mg / kg i . v . ) in anesthetize MAO - inhibited dogs .
869641	2	267	In addition , reflex bradycardia caused by injected norepinephrine was significantly enhanced by L - dopa , DL - Threo - dihydroxyphenylserine had no effect on blood pressure , heart rate or reflex responses to norepinephrine .
869641	3	485	FLA - 63 , a dopamine - beta - oxidase inhibitor , did not have any effect on the hypotension , bradycardia or reflex - enhancing effect of L - dopa .
869641	4	622	Pimozide did not affect the actions of L - dopa on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflexes .
869641	5	753	Removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of norepinephrine .
869641	6	900	However , L - dopa restored the bradycardia caused by norepinephrine in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate . 5 - HTP ( 5 mg / kg i . v . ) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex bradycardia to norepinephrine .
869641	7	1140	It is concluded that L - dopa enhances reflex bradycardia through central alpha - receptor stimulation .
869641	8	1240	Furthermore , the effects are mediated through dopamine rather than norepinephrine and do not require the carotid sinus baroreceptors .
8701950	0	0	Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia complicating FK506 ( tacrolimus ) therapy .
8701950	1	75	We describe 3 episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ( MAHA ) in 2 solid organ recipients under FK506 ( tacrolimus ) therapy .
8701950	2	204	In both cases , discontinuation of FK506 and treatment with plasma exchange , fresh frozen plasma replacement , corticosteroids , aspirin , and dipyridamole led to resolution of MAHA .
8701950	3	383	In one patient , reintroduction of FK506 led to rapid recurrence of MAHA .
8701950	4	456	FK506 - associated MAHA is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication .
8701950	5	553	In our experience and according to the literature , FK506 does not seem to cross - react with cyclosporin A ( CyA ) , an immuno - suppressive drug already known to induce MAHA .
8739323	0	0	Effect of some anticancer drugs and combined chemotherapy on renal toxicity .
8739323	1	77	The nephrotoxic action of anticancer drugs such as nitrogranulogen ( NG ) , methotrexate ( MTX ) , 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) and cyclophosphamide ( CY ) administered alone or in combination [ MTX + 5 - FU + CY ( CMF ) ] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats .
8739323	2	324	After drug administration , creatinine concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined , as well as creatinine clearance .
8739323	3	470	Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed .
8739323	4	532	After MTX administration a significant increase ( p = 0 . 0228 ) in the plasma creatinine concentration and a significant ( p = 0 . 0001 ) decrease in creatinine clearance was noted compared to controls .
8739323	5	728	After the administration of NG , 5 - FU and CY neither a statistically significant increase in creatinine concentration nor an increase in creatinine clearance was observed compared to the group receiving no cytostatics .
8739323	6	946	Following polytherapy according to the CMF regimen , a statistically significant decrease ( p = 0 . 0343 ) in creatinine clearance was found , but creatinine concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls .
8739323	7	1165	CY caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40 % of rats , but it did not cause this complication when combined with 5 - FU and MTX .
8739323	8	1284	Histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of MTX , CY and NG , while no such change was observed after 5 - FU and joint administration of MTX + 5 - FU + CY compared to controls .
8739323	9	1480	Our studies indicate that nephrotoxicity of MTX + 5 - FU + CY administered jointly is lower than in monotherapy .
8741744	0	0	The interpeduncular nucleus regulates nicotine ' s effects on free - field activity .
8741744	1	81	Partial lesions were made with kainic acid in the interpeduncular nucleus of the ventral midbrain of the rat .
8741744	2	191	Compared with sham - operated controls , lesions significantly ( p < 0 . 25 ) blunted the early ( < 60 min ) free - field locomotor hypoactivity caused by nicotine ( 0 . 5 mg kg ( - 1 ) , i . m . ) , enhanced the later ( 60 - 120 min ) nicotine - induced hyperactivity , and raised spontaneous nocturnal activity .
8741744	3	473	Lesions reduced the extent of immunohistological staining for choline acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus ( p < 0 . 025 ) , but not for tyrosine hydroxylase in the surrounding catecholaminergic A10 region .
8741744	4	686	We conclude that the interpeduncular nucleus mediates nicotinic depression of locomotor activity and dampens nicotinic arousal mechanisms located elsewhere in the brain .
8752018	0	0	Lithium - associated cognitive and functional deficits reduced by a switch to divalproex sodium : a case series .
8752018	1	110	BACKGROUND : Lithium remains a first - line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder .
8752018	2	222	Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium , such as polyuria and tremor , more subtle lithium side effects such as cognitive deficits , loss of creativity , and functional impairments remain understudied .
8752018	3	479	This report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to divalproex sodium to alleviate such cognitive and functional impairments .
8752018	4	637	METHOD : Open , case series design .
8752018	5	671	RESULTS : We report seven cases where substitution of lithium , either fully or partially , with divalproex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive , motivational , or creative deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients .
8752018	6	914	CONCLUSION : In this preliminary report , divalproex sodium was a superior alternative to lithium in bipolar patients experiencing cognitive deficits , loss of creativity , and functional impairments .
8829025	0	0	Effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus .
8829025	1	92	The effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving tacrolimus was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996 .
8829025	2	249	Two groups of patients receiving tacrolimus were compared over a period of 1 year , one group comprising hypertensive patients who were receiving nifedipine , and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving nifedipine .
8829025	3	482	The time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients .
8829025	4	548	Nifedipine significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum creatinine levels at 6 and 12 months .
8829025	5	684	The observed positive impact of nifedipine on reducing the nephrotoxicity associated with tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat hypertension in this population .
88336	0	0	Alpha and beta coma in drug intoxication uncomplicated by cerebral hypoxia .
88336	1	76	Four patients who were rendered comatose or stuporous by drug intoxication , but who were not hypoxic , are described .
88336	2	193	Three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal symptoms , and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam .
88336	3	328	The patient with nitrazepam overdose and two of those with chlormethiazole intoxication conformed to the criteria of ' alpha coma ' , showing non - reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG .
88336	4	544	The fourth patient who was unconscious after chlormethiazole administration exhibite generalized non - reactive activity in the slow beta range .
88336	5	687	All four recovered completely without neurological sequelae following the withdrawal of the offending agents .
88336	6	797	The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological depression of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed .
88336	7	940	It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo - thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha coma .
88336	8	1070	It is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication , in the absence of significant hypoxaemia , a favourable outcome may be anticipated .
8864707	0	0	Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in epileptic patients after phenytoin overdosages .
8864707	1	98	The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phenytoin medication and cerebellar atrophy in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication .
8864707	2	260	Five females and 6 males , 21 - 59 years of age , were examined with a 1 . 5 - T whole - body system using a circular polarized head coil .
8864707	3	389	Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation .
8864707	4	477	In addition , we performed a high - resolution 3D gradient echo , T1 - weighted sequences at a 1 - mm slice thickness .
8864707	5	588	The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum .
8864707	6	673	Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67 . 66 and 131 . 08 ml ( mean 108 . 9 ml ) .
8864707	7	765	In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age - matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes .
8864707	8	911	Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration , elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume .
8864707	9	1056	However , multiple regression for the daily dosage , duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters .
8864707	10	1205	We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients .
8864707	11	1406	Quantitative morphometric studies of the cerebellum provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cerebellar disorders .
891050	0	0	Late recovery of renal function in a woman with the hemolytic uremic syndrome .
891050	1	79	A case is reported of the hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) in a woman taking oral contraceptives .
891050	2	176	She was treated with heparin , dipyridamole and hemodialysis ; and after more than three months , her urinary output rose above 500 ml ; and six months after the onset of anuria , dialysis treatment was stopped .
891050	3	383	This case emphasizes the possibility that HUS in adults is not invariably irreversible and that , despite prolonged oliguria , recovery of renal function can be obtained .
891050	4	552	Therefore , in adult patients affected by HUS , dialysis should not be discontinued prematurely ; moreover , bilateral nephrectomy , for treatment of severe hypertension and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , should be performed with caution .
8919272	0	0	Morphological features of encephalopathy after chronic administration of the antiepileptic drug valproate to rats .
8919272	1	115	A transmission electron microscopic study of capillaries in the cerebellar cortex .
8919272	2	198	Long - term intragastric application of the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate ( Vupral " Polfa " ) at the effective dose of 200 mg / kg b . w . once daily to rats for 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months revealed neurological disorders indicating cerebellum damage ( " valproate encephalopathy " ) .
8919272	3	473	The first ultrastructural changes in structural elements of the blood - brain - barrier ( BBB ) in the cerebellar cortex were detectable after 3 months of the experiment .
8919272	4	638	They became more severe in the later months of the experiment , and were most severe after 12 months , located mainly in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex .
8919272	5	803	Lesions of the capillary included necrosis of endothelial cells .
8919272	6	868	Organelles of these cells , in particular the mitochondria ( increased number and size , distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae ) and Golgi apparatus were altered .
8919272	7	1039	Reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had luminal protrusions and swollen microvilli .
8919272	8	1180	Pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes .
8919272	9	1268	Fragments of necrotic endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions .
8919272	10	1411	Damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed .
8919272	11	1469	Damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells , mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes .
8919272	12	1595	The proliferation of astrocytes ( Bergmann ' s in particular ) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found .
8919272	13	1702	Alterations in the structural elements of the BBB coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum ( Purkinje cells are earliest ) .
8919272	14	1842	In electron micrographs both luminal and antiluminal sides of the BBB of the cerebellar cortex had similar lesions .
8919272	15	1958	The possible influence of the hepatic damage , mainly hyperammonemia , upon the development of valproate encephalopathy is discussed .
8953972	0	0	Fatal intracranial bleeding associated with prehospital use of epinephrine .
8953972	1	76	We present a case of paramedic misjudgment in the execution of a protocol for the treatment of allergic reaction in a case of pulmonary edema with wheezing .
8953972	2	233	The sudden onset of respiratory distress , rash , and a history of a new medicine led the two paramedics on the scene to administer subcutaneous epinephrine .
8953972	3	389	Subsequently , acute cardiac arrest and fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred .
8953972	4	468	Epinephrine has a proven role in cardiac arrest in prehospital care ; however , use by paramedics in patients with suspected allergic reaction and severe hypertension should be viewed with caution .
8955532	0	0	Role of activation of bradykinin B2 receptors in disruption of the blood - brain barrier during acute hypertension .
8955532	1	114	Cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood - brain barrier during acute hypertension are not clear .
8955532	2	228	The goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis / release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors in disruption of the blood - brain barrier during acute hypertension .
8955532	3	405	Permeability of the blood - brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent - labeled dextran before and during phenylephrine - induced acute hypertension in rats treated with vehicle and Hoe - 140 ( 0 . 1 microM ) .
8955532	4	619	Phenylephrine infusion increased arterial pressure , arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent dextran by a similar magnitude in both groups .
8955532	5	767	These findings suggest that disruption of the blood - brain barrier during acute hypertension is not related to the synthesis / release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors .
8996652	0	0	Risk factors of sensorineural hearing loss in preterm infants .
8996652	1	63	Among 547 preterm infants of < or = 34 weeks gestation born between 1987 and 1991 , 8 children ( 1 . 46 % ) developed severe progressive and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss .
8996652	2	236	Perinatal risk factors of infants with hearing loss were compared with those of two control groups matched for gestation and birth weight and for perinatal complications .
8996652	3	407	Our observations demonstrated an association of hearing loss with a higher incidence of perinatal complications .
8996652	4	520	Ototoxicity appeared closely related to a prolonged administration and higher total dose of ototoxic drugs , particularly aminoglycosides and furosemide .
8996652	5	673	Finally , we strongly recommend to prospectively and regularly perform audiologic assessment in sick preterm children as hearing loss is of delayed onset and in most cases bilateral and severe .
9034419	0	0	Seizure resulting from a venlafaxine overdose .
9034419	1	47	OBJECTIVE : To report a case of venlafaxine overdose .
9034419	2	100	CASE SUMMARY : A 40 - year - old woman with major depression took an overdose of venlafaxine in an apparent suicide attempt .
9034419	3	220	After the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50 - mg tablets , the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure .
9034419	4	330	She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit , venlafaxine was discontinued , and no further sequelae were seen .
9034419	5	448	DISCUSSION : To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure .
9034419	6	574	Based on nonoverdose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine and the potential risks of available interventions , no emergent therapy was instituted .
9034419	7	736	CONCLUSIONS : The venlafaxine overdose in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized seizure but elicited no further sequelae .
9088814	0	0	Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin E1 - induced hypotension and haemodilution on human hepatic function .
9088814	1	112	Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin E1 ( PGE1 ) - induced hypotension and haemodilution on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery .
9088814	2	276	The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups ; those in group A ( n = 10 ) were subjected to controlled hypotension alone , those in group B ( n = 10 ) to haemodilution alone and those in group C ( n = 10 ) to both controlled hypotension and haemodilution .
9088814	3	540	Haemodilution in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of dextran solution , and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22 % .
9088814	4	735	Controlled hypotension in groups A and C was induced with PGE1 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min .
9088814	5	863	Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio ( AKBR , aceto - acetate / 3 - hydroxybutyrate ) and clinical hepatic function parameters .
9088814	6	994	AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B .
9088814	7	1100	In group C , AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min ( - 40 % ) and at 180 min ( - 49 % ) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min ( - 32 % ) after recovery of normotension , and SGOT , SGPT , LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation .
9088814	8	1357	The results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of PGE1 - induced hypotension and moderate haemodilution would cause impairment of hepatic function .
9100294	0	0	Cardiovascular alterations in rat fetuses exposed to calcium channel blockers .
9100294	1	79	Preclinical toxicologic investigation suggested that a new calcium channel blocker , Ro 40 - 5967 , induced cardiovascular alterations in rat fetuses exposed to this agent during organogenesis .
9100294	2	269	The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers in general induce cardiovascular malformations indicating a pharmacologic class effect .
9100294	3	448	We studied three calcium channel blockers of different structure , nifedipine , diltiazem , and verapamil , along with the new agent .
9100294	4	578	Pregnant rats were administered one of these calcium channel blockers during the period of cardiac morphogenesis and the offspring examined on day 20 of gestation for cardiovascular malformations .
9100294	5	775	A low incidence of cardiovascular malformations was observed after exposure to each of the four calcium channel blockers , but this incidence was statistically significant only for verapamil and nifedipine .
9100294	6	981	All four agents were associated with aortic arch branching variants , although significantly increased only for Ro 40 - 5967 and verapamil .
9195768	0	0	The site of common side effects of sumatriptan .
9195768	1	48	Atypical sensations following the use of subcutaneous sumatriptan are common , but of uncertain origin .
9195768	2	151	They are almost always benign , but can be mistaken for a serious adverse event by the patient .
9195768	3	246	Two patients are presented with tingling or burning sensations limited to areas of heat exposure or sunburn .
9195768	4	355	In these individuals , side effects are most likely generated superficially in the skin .
9199746	0	0	Macula toxicity after intravitreal amikacin .
9199746	1	45	BACKGROUND : Although intravitreal aminoglycosides have substantially improved visual prognosis in endophthalmitis , macular infarction may impair full visual recovery .
9199746	2	212	METHODS : We present a case of presumed amikacin retinal toxicity following treatment with amikacin and vancomycin for alpha - haemolytic streptococcal endophthalmitis .
9199746	3	378	RESULTS : Endophthalmitis resolved with improvement in visual acuity to 6 / 24 at three months .
9199746	4	471	Fundus fluorescein angiography confirmed macular capillary closure and telangiectasis .
9199746	5	558	CONCLUSIONS : Currently accepted intravitreal antibiotic regimens may cause retinal toxicity and macular ischaemia .
9199746	6	673	Treatment strategies aimed at avoiding retinal toxicity are discussed .
9245658	0	0	The role of nicotine in smoking - related cardiovascular disease .
9245658	1	64	Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease .
9245658	2	174	Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis , but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect .
9245658	3	370	Almost certainly , nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events , although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide .
9245658	4	648	Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans .
9245658	5	709	Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events .
9245658	6	891	Finally , the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat , suggesting that if nicotine is involved , adverse effects might be seen with relatively low - level cigarette exposures .
9249847	0	0	Iatrogenically induced intractable atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia after verapamil and catheter ablation in a patient with Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy .
9249847	1	200	In a patient with WPW syndrome and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy , intractable atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia ( AVRT ) was iatrogenically induced .
9249847	2	356	QRS without preexcitation , caused by junctional escape beats after verapamil or unidirectional antegrade block of accessory pathway after catheter ablation , established frequent AVRT attack .
9284778	0	0	Epidemic of liver disease caused by hydrochlorofluorocarbons used as ozone - sparing substitutes of chlorofluorocarbons .
9284778	1	119	BACKGROUND : Hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs ) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for ozone - depleting chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) .
9284778	2	261	Limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds .
9284778	3	350	We investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1 , 1 - dichloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane ( HCFC 123 ) and 1 - chloro - 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 - tetrafluoroethane ( HCFC 124 ) .
9284778	4	576	All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees .
9284778	5	635	Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1 - bromo - 1 - chloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane ( halothane ) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates , which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane .
9284778	6	854	We aimed to test whether HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease .
9284778	7	934	METHODS : For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done .
9284778	8	1086	The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome - P450 2E1 ( P450 2E1 ) and P58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform ( P58 ) .
9284778	9	1279	FINDINGS : The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas ( bridging necrosis ) .
9284778	10	1492	Trifluoroacetyl - adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes .
9284778	11	1566	Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58 , previously associated with halothane hepatitis , were detected in the serum of five affected workers .
9284778	12	1707	INTERPRETATION : Repeated exposure of human beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population .
9284778	13	1862	Although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known , the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl - altered liver proteins are involved .
9284778	14	2017	In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds , there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives .
9293063	0	0	Bile duct hamartoma occurring in association with long - term treatment with danazol .
9293063	1	84	We report a case of bile duct hamartoma which developed in a patient who had been on long - term danazol treatment .
9293063	2	198	Such patients should be under close follow - up , preferably with periodic ultrasound examination of the liver .
9293063	3	307	If the patient develops a liver mass , because of non - specific clinical features and imaging appearances , biopsy may be the only way to achieve a definitive diagnosis .
9334596	0	0	Endocrine screening in 1 , 022 men with erectile dysfunction : clinical significance and cost - effective strategy .
9334596	1	111	PURPOSE : We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1 , 022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history , results of physical examination , other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost - effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities .
9334596	2	512	MATERIALS AND METHODS : Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay .
9334596	3	599	Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire , gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng . / ml .
9334596	4	763	Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results .
9334596	5	825	Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1 , 340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination .
9334596	6	982	Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire , small testes and gynecomastia .
9334596	7	1113	Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia .
9334596	8	1258	RESULTS : Testosterone was less than 3 ng . / ml . in 107 patients but normal in 40 % at repeat determination .
9334596	9	1363	The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age ( 4 % before age 50 years and 9 % 50 years or older ) .
9334596	10	1479	Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination .
9334596	11	1550	Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction ( definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [ 36 % ] after androgen therapy , normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30 % and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42 % ) .
9334596	12	1925	Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40 % of the cases with low testosterone , including 37 % of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy .
9334596	13	2142	Prolactin exceeded 20 ng . / ml . in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination .
9334596	14	2226	Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered .
9334596	15	2262	These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades ( overall prolactin greater than 20 ng . / ml . in 1 . 86 % of 1 , 821 patients , prolactinomas in 7 , 0 . 38 % ) .
9334596	16	2428	Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml . ( 8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng . / ml . ) .
9334596	17	2598	Testosterone was low in less than 50 % of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml .
9334596	18	2684	CONCLUSIONS : Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination .
9334596	19	2832	However , cost - effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50 % of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors .
9334596	20	2980	We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years .
9334596	21	3173	Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire , gynecomastia and / or testosterone less than 4 ng . / ml .
9351491	0	0	Extrapyramidal side effects with risperidone and haloperidol at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels .
9351491	1	105	Risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5 - HT2 receptors .
9351491	2	207	Previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone ' s pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects ; features shared by so - called ' atypical ' neuroleptics .
9351491	3	462	To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects , we used [ 123I ] IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone ( n = 12 ) or haloperidol ( n = 7 ) .
9351491	4	748	Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90 % at standard clinical doses .
9351491	5	871	There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone .
9351491	6	974	Drug - induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone ( 42 % ) and haloperidol ( 29 % ) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60 % .
9351491	7	1126	Based on these observations , it is concluded that 5 - HT2 blockade obtained with risperidone at D2 occupancy rates of 60 % and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects .
9390208	0	0	Treatment of previously treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone and 48 - hour continuous infusion of high - dose 5 - FU and leucovorin ( MFL ) : low palliative benefit and high treatment - related toxicity .
9390208	1	205	For previously treated advanced breast cancer , there is no standard second - line therapy .
9390208	2	294	Combination chemotherapy with mitoxantrone , high - dose 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) and leucovorin ( MFL regimen ) had been reported as an effective and well tolerated regimen .
9390208	3	461	From October 1993 to November 1995 , we treated 13 patients with previously chemotherapy - treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone , 12 mg / m2 , on day 1 and continuous infusion of 5 - FU , 3000 mg / m2 , together with leucovorin , 300 mg / m2 , for 48 h from day 1 to 2 .
9390208	4	726	Each course of chemotherapy was given every 4 weeks .
9390208	5	779	Most of these patients had more than two metastatic sites , with lung metastasis predominant .
9390208	6	872	Seven patients had been treated with anthracycline .
9390208	7	924	Seven patients had previously received radiotherapy and seven had received hormone therapy .
9390208	8	1016	Median number of courses of MFL regimen given was six and the median cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was 68 . 35 mg / m2 .
9390208	9	1134	One patient had complete response , seven had stable disease , none had partial response and five had progressive disease .
9390208	10	1255	The overall objective response rate was 7 . 6 % .
9390208	11	1301	The median follow - up period was 14 months .
9390208	12	1344	Median survival was 16 months .
9390208	13	1375	Median progression - free survival was 5 months .
9390208	14	1422	A complete responder had relapse - free survival up to 17 months .
9390208	15	1486	Major toxicities were cardiotoxicity and leukopenia .
9390208	16	1539	Eight patients were dead in the last follow - up ; two of them died of treatment - related toxicity .
9390208	17	1635	The MFL regimen achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe toxicity at a fairly high rate .
9390208	18	1737	Administration of this regimen to breast cancer patients who have been treated by chemotherapy and those with impaired heart function requires careful attention .
9401499	0	0	Ticlopidine - induced aplastic anemia : report of three Chinese patients and review of the literature .
9401499	1	100	In this study , three Chinese patients with ticlopidine - induced aplastic anemia were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed .
9401499	2	258	We attempted to find underlying similarities , evaluate the risk factors , and identify appropriate treatment for this complication .
9401499	3	389	All but one of the patients were over 60 years old , and the 6 who died were all older than 65 .
9401499	4	484	Therefore , old age may be a risk factor for developing this complication .
9401499	5	558	Agranulocytosis occurred 3 - 20 weeks after initiation of ticlopidine , so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended .
9401499	6	704	There seemed to be no direct correlation between the dose or duration used and the severity of bone marrow suppression .
9401499	7	824	Treatment for ticlopidine - induced aplastic anemia with colony - stimulating factors seemed to have little effect .
9401499	8	936	The fact that 5 of the 6 patients who received concurrent calcium channel blockers died , should alert clinicians to be more cautious when using these two drugs simultaneously .
9406968	0	0	Upregulation of the expression of vasopressin gene in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the lithium - induced diabetes insipidus rat .
9406968	1	143	The expression of arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) gene in the paraventricular ( PVN ) and supraoptic nuclei ( SON ) was investigated in rats with lithium ( Li ) - induced polyuria , using in situ hybridization histochemistry and radioimmunoassay .
9406968	2	376	The male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained LiCl ( 60 mmol / kg ) for 4 weeks developed marked polyuria .
9406968	3	486	The Li - treated rats produced a large volume of hypotonic urine with low ionic concentrations .
9406968	4	580	Plasma sodium concentrations were found to be slightly increased in the Li - treated rats compared with those in controls .
9406968	5	701	Plasma concentration of AVP and transcripts of AVP gene in the PVN and SON were significantly increased in the Li - treated rats compared with controls .
9406968	6	852	These results suggest that dehydration and / or the activation of visceral afferent inputs may contribute to the elevation of plasma AVP and the upregulation of AVP gene expression in the PVN and the SON of the Li - induced diabetes insipidus rat .
9495837	0	0	Antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of the presynaptic cholinergic amplifier PG - 9 .
9495837	1	90	The antinociceptive effect of 3 alpha - tropyl 2 - ( p - bromophenyl ) propionate [ ( + / - ) - PG - 9 ] ( 10 - 40 mg kg - 1 s . c . ; 30 - 60 mg kg - 1 p . o . ; 10 - 30 mg kg - 1 i . v . ; 10 - 30 micrograms / mouse i . c . v . ) was examined in mice , rats and guinea pigs by use of the hot - plate , abdominal - constriction , tail - flick and paw - pressure tests . ( + / - ) - PG - 9 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished .
9495837	2	480	The antinociception produced by ( + / - ) - PG - 9 was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist atropine , the M1 - selective antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine and the acetylcholine depletor hemicholinium - 3 , but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone , the gamma - aminobutyric acidB antagonist 3 - aminopropyl - diethoxy - methyl - phosphinic acid , the H3 agonist R - ( alpha ) - methylhistamine , the D2 antagonist quinpirole , the 5 - hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist 2 - methoxy - 4 - amino - 5 - chlorobenzoic acid 2 - ( diethylamino ) ethyl ester hydrochloride , the 5 - hydroxytryptamin1A antagonist 1 - ( 2 - methoxyphenyl ) - 4 - [ 4 - ( 2 - phthalimido ) butyl ] piperazine hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor reserpine .
9495837	3	1158	Based on these data , it can be postulated that ( + / - ) - PG - 9 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission . ( + / - ) - PG - 9 ( 10 - 40 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) was able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 1 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) and dicyclomine ( 2 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) in the mouse passive - avoidance test .
9495837	4	1484	Affinity profiles of ( + / - ) - PG - 9 for muscarinic receptor subtypes , determined by functional studies ( rabbit vas deferens for M1 , guinea pig atrium for M2 , guinea pig ileum for M3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M4 ) , have shown an M4 / M1 selectivity ratio of 10 . 2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti - amnesic effect induced by ( + / - ) - PG - 9 through an increase in acetylcholine extracellular levels .
9495837	5	1916	In the antinociceptive and antiamnesic dose range , ( + / - ) - PG - 9 did not impair mouse performance evaluated by the rota - rod test and Animex apparatus .
9522143	0	0	The effect of different anaesthetic agents in hearing loss following spinal anaesthesia .
9522143	1	89	The cause of hearing loss after spinal anaesthesia is unknown .
9522143	2	152	Up until now , the only factor studied has been the effect of the diameter of the spinal needle on post - operative sensorineural hearing loss .
9522143	3	293	The aim of this study was to describe this hearing loss and to investigate other factors influencing the degree of hearing loss .
9522143	4	422	Two groups of 22 similar patients were studied : one group received 6 mL prilocaine 2 % ; and the other received 3 mL bupivacaine 0 . 5 % .
9522143	5	555	Patients given prilocaine were more likely to develop hearing loss ( 10 out of 22 ) than those given bupivacaine ( 4 out of 22 ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
9522143	6	692	The average hearing loss for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after prilocaine and 15 dB after bupivacaine .
9522143	7	802	None of the patients complained of subjective hearing loss .
9522143	8	862	Long - term follow - up of the patients was not possible .
9522152	0	0	A transient neurological deficit following intrathecal injection of 1 % hyperbaric bupivacaine for unilateral spinal anaesthesia .
9522152	1	129	We describe a case of transient neurological deficit that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1 % hyperbaric bupivacaine slowly injected through a 25 - gauge pencil - point spinal needle .
9522152	2	334	The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful , but 3 days after surgery , the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L3 - L4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on ( loss of pinprick sensation ) without reduction in muscular strength .
9522152	3	580	Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks .
9522152	4	650	Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow - up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect .
9522152	5	811	However , we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution ( if pencil - point needle and slow injection rate are employed ) , in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration , which might lead to a transient neurological deficit .
9523805	0	0	Transient neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia : a lower incidence with prilocaine and bupivacaine than with lidocaine .
9523805	1	126	BACKGROUND : Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms ( TNSs ) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine .
9523805	2	288	However , identification of a short - acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal .
9523805	3	432	Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine .
9523805	4	528	Accordingly , the present , prospective double - blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs .
9523805	5	698	METHODS : Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2 . 5 ml 2 % lidocaine in 7 . 5 % glucose , 2 % prilocaine in 7 . 5 % glucose , or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine in 7 . 5 % glucose .
9523805	6	1015	All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy .
9523805	7	1086	Details of spinal puncture , extension and regression of spinal block , and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted .
9523805	8	1210	In the evening of postoperative day 1 , patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure .
9523805	9	1375	RESULTS : Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs , 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine ( P = 0 . 03 ) had them , and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs .
9523805	10	1557	Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine ( 150 vs . 165 min and 238 vs . 253 min , respectively ) but prolonged after bupivacaine ( 200 and 299 min , respectively ; P < 0 . 05 ) .
9523805	11	1758	CONCLUSIONS : Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs .
9587734	0	0	Suxamethonium - induced cardiac arrest and death following 5 days of immobilization .
9587734	1	83	The present report describes a case of cardiac arrest and subsequent death as a result of hyperkalaemia following the use of suxamethonium in a 23 - year - old Malawian woman .
9587734	2	255	Five days after the onset of the symptoms of meningitis , the patient aspirated stomach contents and needed endotracheal intubation .
9587734	3	387	Forty seconds after injection of suxamethonium , bradycardia and cardiac arrest occurred .
9587734	4	476	Attempts to resuscitate the patient were not successful .
9587734	5	533	The serum level of potassium was observed to be 8 . 4 mequiv L - 1 .
9587734	6	597	Apart from the reduction in the patient ' s level of consciousness , there were no signs of motor neurone damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for hyperkalaemia following the administration of suxamethonium .
9587734	7	825	It is postulated that her death was caused by hypersensitivity to suxamethonium , associated with her 5 - day immobilization .
9625142	0	0	Acute hepatitis , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , and erythroblastocytopenia induced by ceftriaxone .
9625142	1	97	An 80 - yr - old man developed acute hepatitis shortly after ingesting oral ceftriaxone .
9625142	2	182	Although the transaminases gradually returned to baseline after withholding the beta lactam antibiotic , there was a gradual increase in serum bilirubin and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration caused by an autoimmune hemolytic anemia and erythroblastocytopenia .
9625142	3	446	These responded to systemic steroids and immunoglobulins .
9625142	4	504	Despite the widespread use of these agents this triad of side effects has not previously been reported in connection with beta lactam antibiotics .
9653867	0	0	Thyroxine abuse : an unusual case of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy .
9653867	1	65	Eating disorders and the associated behavioural problems and drug abuse are uncommon in pregnancy .
9653867	2	164	When they do occur they are often unrecognized because of denial but when significant may pose a risk to both the mother and her fetus .
9653867	3	300	This case illustrates a number of problems that may be encountered in women with eating disorders in pregnancy , including prolonged and recurrent metabolic disturbances and diuretic abuse .
9653867	4	489	In particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with eating disorders and reminds us that when a cause for thyrotoxicosis remains obscure , thyroxine abuse should be considered and explored .
9660111	0	0	Repeated trimipramine induces dopamine D2 / D3 and alpha1 - adrenergic up - regulation .
9660111	1	82	Trimipramine ( TRI ) , which shows a clinical antidepressant activity , is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5 - hydroxytryptamine , nor does it induce beta - adrenergic down - regulation .
9660111	2	314	The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown .
9660111	3	377	The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1 - adrenergic systems , demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants .
9660111	4	597	TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days .
9660111	5	693	In the acute experiment TRI ( given i . p . ) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5 - hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats .
9660111	6	859	TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d - amphetamine , quinpirole and ( + ) - 7 - hydroxy - dipropyloaminotetralin ( dopamine D2 and D3 effects ) .
9660111	7	1034	The stereotypies induced by d - amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by TRI .
9660111	8	1119	It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine ( given intraventricularly ) in rats , evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice , both these effects being mediated by an alpha1 - adrenergic receptor .
9660111	9	1378	It may be concluded that , like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously , TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 ( locomotor activity but not stereotypy ) as well as alpha1 - adrenergic receptors to their agonists .
9660111	10	1637	A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants , suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity .
9672936	0	0	Pethidine - associated seizure in a healthy adolescent receiving pethidine for postoperative pain control .
9672936	1	105	A healthy 17 - year - old male received standard intermittent doses of pethidine via a patient - controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump for management of postoperative pain control .
9672936	2	274	Twenty - three h postoperatively he developed a brief self - limited seizure .
9672936	3	348	Both plasma pethidine and norpethidine were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation .
9672936	4	492	No other risk factors for CNS toxicity were identified .
9672936	5	548	This method allowed frequent self - dosing of pethidine at short time intervals and rapid accumulation of pethidine and norpethidine .
9672936	6	680	The routine use of pethidine via PCA even for a brief postoperative analgesia should be reconsidered .
9698967	0	0	An unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by mepivacaine with adrenaline .
9698967	1	76	An increase in blood pressure , accompanied by atrial fibrillation , agitation , incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness , was observed in an elderly , ASA classification group II , cardiovascularly medicated male , 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0 . 225 mg , for correction of Dupuytren ' s contracture .
9698967	2	437	After intravenous administration of labetalol , metoprolol and midazolam the patient ' s condition improved , and 15 min later he woke up .
9698967	3	572	The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation .
9698967	4	676	Postoperatively , the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically .
9698967	5	757	Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and / or interaction of these drugs with the patient ' s cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications .
9721172	0	0	Drug - associated acute - onset vanishing bile duct and Stevens - Johnson syndromes in a child .
9721172	1	90	Acute vanishing bile duct syndrome is a rare but established cause of progressive cholestasis in adults , is most often drug or toxin related , and is of unknown pathogenesis .
9721172	2	264	It has not been reported previously in children .
9721172	3	313	Stevens - Johnson syndrome is a well - recognized immune complex - mediated hypersensitivity reaction that affects all age groups , is drug or infection induced , and has classic systemic , mucosal , and dermatologic manifestations .
9721172	4	536	A previously healthy child who developed acute , severe , rapidly progressive vanishing bile duct syndrome shortly after Stevens - Johnson syndrome is described ; this was temporally associated with ibuprofen use .
9721172	5	745	Despite therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid , prednisone , and then tacrolimus , her cholestatic disease was unrelenting , with cirrhosis shown by biopsy 6 months after presentation .
9721172	6	922	This case documents acute drug - related vanishing bile duct syndrome in the pediatric age group and suggests shared immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both Stevens - Johnson syndrome and vanishing bile duct syndrome .
9727773	0	0	High incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension associated with appetite suppressants in Belgium .
9727773	1	99	Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare , progressive and incurable disease , which has been associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs .
9727773	2	249	The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants .
9727773	3	399	Thirty - five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months ( 1992 - 1994 ) in Belgium .
9727773	4	534	Exposure to appetite - suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview .
9727773	5	642	Twenty - three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants , mainly fenfluramines , as compared with only 5 of the controls ( 66 versus 6 % , p < 0 . 0001 ) .
9727773	6	803	Five patients died before the interview , all of them had taken appetite suppressants .
9727773	7	889	In 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain , 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants .
9727773	8	1009	The patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill , and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis .
9727773	9	1187	A policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite suppressants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hypertension .
9727773	10	1325	Intake of appetite suppressants may accelerate the progression of the disease .
9746003	0	0	Inappropriate use of carbamazepine and vigabatrin in typical absence seizures .
9746003	1	79	Carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures .
9746003	2	157	Of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only , eight were erroneously treated with carbamazepine either as monotherapy or as an add - on .
9746003	3	324	Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children .
9746003	4	383	Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic jerks , which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine .
9746003	5	550	Absences were aggravated in both cases where vigabatrin was added on to concurrent treatment .
9746003	6	644	Optimal control of the absences was achieved with sodium valproate , lamotrigine , or ethosuximide alone or in combination .
9754849	0	0	Choreoathetoid movements associated with rapid adjustment to methadone .
9754849	1	72	Choreatiform hyperkinesias are known to be occasional movement abnormalities during intoxications with cocaine but not opiates .
9754849	2	200	This is a case report of euphoria and choreoathetoid movements both transiently induced by rapid adjustment to the selective mu - opioid receptor agonist methadone in an inpatient previously abusing heroine and cocaine .
9754849	3	418	In addition , minor EEG abnormalities occurred .
9754849	4	465	Possible underlying neurobiological phenomena are discussed .
9766615	0	0	Adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics .
9766615	1	48	Collaborative Working Group on Clinical Trial Evaluations .
9766615	2	107	Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance .
9766615	3	170	Thus , clinicians should address patients ' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients ' quality of life as well as overall health .
9766615	4	354	The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics .
9766615	5	477	Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects , including extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) , tardive dyskinesia , sedation , and possible impairment of some cognitive measures , as well as cardiac effects , orthostatic hypotension , hepatic changes , anticholinergic side effects , sexual dysfunction , and weight gain .
9766615	6	818	The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS , but are associated in varying degrees with sedation , cardiovascular effects , anticholinergic effects , weight gain , sexual dysfunction , hepatic effects , lowered seizure threshold ( primarily clozapine ) , and agranulocytosis ( clozapine only ) .
9766615	7	1109	Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals , the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual ' s dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient .
9812111	0	0	A randomized , placebo - controlled dose - comparison trial of haloperidol for psychosis and disruptive behaviors in Alzheimer ' s disease .
9812111	1	133	OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease .
9812111	2	345	METHOD : In a 6 - week random - assignment , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( phase A ) , haloperidol , 2 - 3 mg / day ( standard dose ) , and haloperidol , 0 . 50 - 0 . 75 mg / day ( low dose ) , were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer ' s disease .
9812111	3	579	For the subsequent 6 - week double - blind crossover phase ( phase B ) , patients taking standard - or low - dose haloperidol were switched to placebo , and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard - or low - dose haloperidol .
9812111	4	810	RESULTS : For the 60 patients who completed phase A , standard - dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low - dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation .
9812111	5	1054	Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose ( 55 % - 60 % ) than the low dose ( 25 % - 35 % ) and placebo ( 25 % - 30 % ) .
9812111	6	1202	The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B .
9812111	7	1274	In phase A , extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions , primarily because of a subgroup ( 20 % ) who developed moderate to severe signs .
9812111	8	1463	Low - dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects .
9812111	9	1556	CONCLUSIONS : The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2 - 3 mg / day , although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs .
9812111	10	1734	A starting dose of 1 mg / day with gradual , upward dose titration is recommended .
9812111	11	1814	The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer ' s disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors .
983936	0	0	Effects of acetylsalicylic acid , dipyridamole , and hydrocortisone on epinephrine - induced myocardial injury in dogs .
983936	1	116	A reproducible model for producing diffuse myocardial injury ( epinephrine infusion ) has been developed to study the cardioprotective effects of agents or maneuvers which might alter the evolution of acute myocardial infarction .
983936	2	344	Infusions of epinephrine ( 4 mug per kilogram per minute for 6 hours ) increased radiocalcium uptakes into intact myocardium and each of its subcellular components with the mitochondrial fraction showing the most consistent changes when compared to saline - infused control animals ( 4 , 957 vs . 827 counts per minute per gram of dried tissue or fraction ) .
983936	3	694	Myocardial concentrations of calcium also increased significantly ( 12 . 0 vs . 5 . 0 mg . per 100 Gm . of fat - free dry weight ) .
983936	4	814	Infusions of calcium chloride sufficient to raise serum calcium concentrations 2 mEq . per liter failed to increase calcium influx into the myocardial cell .
983936	5	970	Mitochondrial radiocalcium uptakes were significantly decreased in animals pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid or dipyridamole or when hydrocortisone was added to the epinephrine infusion ( 2 , 682 , 2 , 803 , and 3 , 424 counts per minute per gram of dried fraction , respectively ) .
983936	6	1244	Myocardial calcium concentrations also were decreased ( 11 . 2 , 8 . 3 , and 8 . 9 mg . per 100 Gm . of fat - free dry weight , respectively ) in the three treatment groups , being significantly decreased only in the last two .
983936	7	1455	Evidence of microscopic damage was graded as less severe in the three treatment groups .
983936	8	1543	Acetylsalicylic acid , dipyridamole , and hydrocortisone all appear to have cardioprotective effects when tested in this model .
9855119	0	0	Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus ( FK506 ) for at least one year .
9855119	1	116	BACKGROUND : We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus ( FK506 ) for more than 1 year .
9855119	2	276	METHODS : Twenty - six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated .
9855119	3	433	Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent ( nonepisode biopsy ) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy ( episode biopsy ) .
9855119	4	663	RESULTS : The main pathologic diagnoses ( some overlap ) were acute rejection ( AR ; n = 4 ) , chronic rejection ( CR ; n = 5 ) , AR + CR ( n = 4 ) , recurrent IgA nephropathy ( n = 5 ) , normal findings ( n = 2 ) , minimal - type chronic FK506 nephropathy ( n = 9 ) , and mild - type FK506 nephropathy ( n = 11 ) .
9855119	5	942	Of the nonepisode biopsies , 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal - type and mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy , respectively .
9855119	6	1062	Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization ( 5 biopsies ) , arteriolopathy ( angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall ; 20 biopsies ) , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( 4 biopsies ) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis ( 11 biopsies ) .
9855119	7	1334	The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy group , which included 7 episode biopsies , were statistically higher than those in the minimum - type chronic FK506 - nephropathy group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
9855119	8	1560	CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall , and suggests that mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function .
9862868	0	0	Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis .
9862868	1	130	Hepatocyte tight junctions ( TJs ) , the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces , play a key role in bile formation .
9862868	2	281	Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis , attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze - fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information .
9862868	3	470	Recently , several TJ - associated proteins like ZO - 1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized .
9862868	4	569	Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability .
9862868	5	656	We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation ( BDL ) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage .
9862868	6	842	Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double - immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO - 1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope .
9862868	7	972	In control rats , immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion .
9862868	8	1085	In contrast , 7H6 and ZO - 1 immunostaining was more discontinuous , outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL .
9862868	9	1191	Immunostaining for 7H6 , not ZO - 1 , decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL .
9862868	10	1350	After EE treatment , changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL , but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule .
9862868	11	1531	This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability .
9869257	0	0	Memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the acetylcholine releaser PG - 9 .
9869257	1	116	The effects of PG - 9 ( 3alpha - tropyl 2 - ( p - bromophenyl ) propionate ) , the acetylcholine releaser , on memory processes and nerve growth factor ( NGF ) synthesis were evaluated .
9869257	2	285	In the mouse passive - avoidance test , PG - 9 ( 10 - 30 mg / kg , i . p . ) , administered 20 min before the training session , prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the M1 - selective antagonist S - ( - ) - ET - 126 .
9869257	3	527	In the same experimental conditions , PG - 9 ( 5 - 20 microg per mouse , i . c . v . ) was also able to prevent antimuscarine - induced amnesia , demonstrating a central localization of the activity .
9869257	4	711	At the highest effective doses , PG - 9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test , and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity , as revealed by the hole - board test .
9869257	5	923	PG - 9 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose - dependent manner .
9869257	6	1032	The maximal NGF contents obtained by PG - 9 were 17 . 6 - fold of the control value .
9869257	7	1111	During culture , no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of PG - 9 .
9869257	8	1200	The current work indicates the ability of PG - 9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells .
9869257	9	1360	Therefore , PG - 9 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes .
9931093	0	0	Mechanisms of FK 506 - induced hypertension in the rat . - Tacrolimus ( FK 506 ) is a powerful , widely used immunosuppressant .
9931093	1	121	The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity .
9931093	2	215	To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506 - induced hypertension , we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin - 1 ( ET - 1 ) , the expression of mRNA of ET - 1 and endothelin - converting enzyme - 1 ( ECE - 1 ) , the endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) activity , and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C - type natriuretic peptide ( CNP ) in rat blood vessels .
9931093	3	579	In addition , the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506 - induced hypertension in rats was studied .
9931093	4	719	FK 506 , 5 mg . kg - 1 . d - 1 given for 4 weeks , elevated blood pressure from 102 + / - 13 to 152 + / - 15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET - 1 and the levels of ET - 1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery ( 240 % and 230 % , respectively ) .
9931093	5	938	Little change was observed in the expression of ECE - 1 mRNA and CNP mRNA .
9931093	6	1011	FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta ( 48 % and 55 % , respectively ) .
9931093	7	1112	The administration of FR 139317 ( 10 mg . kg - 1 . d - 1 ) prevented FK 506 - induced hypertension in rats .
9931093	8	1210	These results indicate that FK 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET - 1 production but also by decreasing NO synthesis in the vasculature .
10027919	0	0	22 - oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal failure .
10027919	1	121	BACKGROUND : Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks , including hypercalcemia and / or marked suppression of bone turnover , which may lead to adynamic bone disease .
10027919	2	372	A new vitamin D analogue , 22 - oxacalcitriol ( OCT ) , has been shown to have promising characteristics .
10027919	3	472	This study was undertaken to determine the effects of OCT on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function .
10027919	4	616	METHODS : Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized ( Nx , N = 38 ) or sham - operated ( Sham , N = 22 ) .
10027919	5	709	The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion .
10027919	6	779	Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation , half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of OCT ( three times per week ) ; the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks .
10027919	7	963	Thereafter , the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months .
10027919	8	1074	Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study , and bone biopsies were done at baseline , 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment , and at the end of the crossover period .
10027919	9	1296	RESULTS : In Nx dogs , OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency .
10027919	10	1411	In long - standing secondary hyperparathyroidism , OCT ( 0 . 03 microg / kg ) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months .
10027919	11	1533	Serum PTH levels rose thereafter , but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control .
10027919	12	1657	These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia .
10027919	13	1740	In animals with normal renal function , OCT induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0 . 1 microg / kg , which was not sustained with lowering of the doses .
10027919	14	1912	In Nx dogs , OCT reversed abnormal bone formation , such as woven osteoid and fibrosis , but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover .
10027919	15	2058	In addition , OCT improved mineralization lag time , ( that is , the rate at which osteoid mineralizes ) in both Nx and Sham dogs .
10027919	16	2184	CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that even though OCT does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency , it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and , therefore , does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease .
10074612	0	0	Hypotension , bradycardia , and asystole after high - dose intravenous methylprednisolone in a monitored patient .
10074612	1	110	We report a case of hypotension , bradycardia , and asystole after intravenous administration of high - dose methylprednisolone in a 73 - year - old patient who underwent electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring throughout the episode .
10074612	2	335	There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier .
10074612	3	400	The patient was admitted with a pulmonary - renal syndrome with hemoptysis , rapidly progressive renal failure , and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit .
10074612	4	588	After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation , the patient recovered cardiac rhythm .
10074612	5	682	The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia .
10074612	6	749	This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone ( IVMP ) .
10074612	7	876	These mechanisms are not well understood because , in most cases , the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event .
10074612	8	1001	Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here , and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism .
10091616	0	0	Worsening of levodopa - induced dyskinesias by motor and mental tasks .
10091616	1	69	Ten patients who had Parkinson ' s disease with disabling dyskinesia were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental ( mental calculation ) and motor ( flexion / extension of right fingers , flexion / extension of left fingers , flexion / extension of the neck , speaking aloud ) tasks on the worsening of peak - dose dyskinesia following administration of an effective single dose of apomorphine .
10091616	2	461	Compared with the score at rest ( 1 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 ) , a significant aggravation of the dyskinesia score was observed during speaking aloud ( 5 . 2 + / - 1 . 1 , p < 0 . 05 ) , movements of right ( 4 . 5 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) and left ( 3 . 7 + / - 0 . 8 , p < 0 . 05 ) fingers , movements of the neck ( 5 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) , and mental calculation ( 3 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) .
10091616	3	776	These results suggest that activation tasks such as " speaking aloud " could be used for objective assessment of dyskinesia severity .
10193809	0	0	Urine N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase - - a marker of tubular damage ?
10193809	1	67	BACKGROUND : Although an indicator of renal tubular dysfunction , an increased urinary N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells .
10193809	2	266	METHODS : Puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria .
10193809	3	370	Total protein , albumin , NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days .
10193809	4	493	The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three , four , six , eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero , four , eight and thirty three .
10193809	5	674	RESULTS : Following intravenous PAN urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two , but returned to normal by day four .
10193809	6	817	After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin , total protein excretion and NAG activity .
10193809	7	936	Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards .
10193809	8	1056	Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four .
10193809	9	1128	Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets ( day six onwards ) .
10193809	10	1310	CONCLUSIONS : This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity , occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells .

10225068	1	185	Six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993 - 1997 .
10225068	2	325	All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine .
10225068	3	401	Five cases had single - shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block .
10225068	4	512	The dose of hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg .
10225068	5	588	Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine .
10225068	6	684	In the other 3 cases , direct neurotoxicity was also probable , but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology .
10225068	7	853	All cases sustained permanent neurological deficits .
10225068	8	906	We recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2 % and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg .
10328196	0	0	Systemic toxicity following administration of sirolimus ( formerly rapamycin ) for psoriasis : association of capillary leak syndrome with apoptosis of lesional lymphocytes .
10328196	1	171	BACKGROUND : Sirolimus ( formerly rapamycin ) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T - cell activation .
10328196	2	284	After 2 individuals with psoriasis developed a capillary leak syndrome following treatment with oral sirolimus lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis .
10328196	3	494	OBSERVATIONS : A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with sirolimus - induced capillary leak syndrome had a 2 . 3 - fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells ( to 48 % ) compared with an unaffected sirolimus - treated patient with psoriasis ( 21 % ) .
10328196	4	737	Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone - induced apoptosis than did normal T cells , particularly in the presence of sirolimus .
10328196	5	942	CONCLUSIONS : Severe adverse effects of sirolimus include fever , anemia , and capillary leak syndrome .
10328196	6	1043	These symptoms may be the result of drug - induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes , especially activated T lymphocytes , and possibly release of inflammatory mediators .
10328196	7	1210	Because patients with severe psoriasis may develop capillary leak from various systemic therapies , clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with inflammatory diseases who are treated with immune modulators .
10354657	0	0	Effect of lithium maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function .
10354657	1	75	OBJECTIVES : To assess changes induced by lithium maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid , parathyroid and ion alterations .
10354657	2	206	These were evaluated with respect to the duration of lithium therapy , age , sex , and family history ( whether or not the patient had a first - degree relative with thyroid disease ) .
10354657	3	384	DESIGN : Prospective study .
10354657	4	411	SETTING : Affective Disorders Clinic at St . Mary ' s Hospital , Montreal .
10354657	5	481	PATIENTS : One hundred and one patients ( 28 men and 73 women ) with bipolar disorder receiving lithium maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year ' s to 32 years ' duration .
10354657	6	647	The control group consisted of 82 patients with no psychiatric or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital ' s out - patient clinics .
10354657	7	781	OUTCOME MEASURES : Laboratory analyses of calcium , magnesium and thyroid - stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning lithium therapy and at biannual follow - up .
10354657	8	950	RESULTS : Hypothyroidism developed in 40 patients , excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at baseline .
10354657	9	1055	All patients having first - degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism ( 3 . 7 years after onset of lithium therapy ) compared with patients without a family history ( 8 . 6 years after onset of lithium therapy ) .
10354657	10	1301	Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by hypothyroidism than women under 60 years of age ( 34 . 6 % versus 31 . 9 % ) .
10354657	11	1426	Magnesium levels in patients on lithium treatment were unchanged from baseline levels .
10354657	12	1513	After lithium treatment , calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels .
10354657	13	1612	Thus , lithium treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with aging .
10354657	14	1710	CONCLUSIONS : Familial thyroid illness is a risk factor for hypothyroidism and hypercalcemia during lithium therapy .
10411803	0	0	Severe immune hemolytic anemia associated with prophylactic use of cefotetan in obstetric and gynecologic procedures .
10411803	1	118	Second - and third - generation cephalosporins , especially cefotetan , are increasingly associated with severe , sometimes fatal immune hemolytic anemia .
10411803	2	267	We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of cefotetan - induced hemolytic anemias were in patients who had received cefotetan prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures .
10411803	3	444	Eight of these cases of severe immune hemolytic anemia are described .
10414674	0	0	Effects of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage .
10414674	1	115	Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) with prominent anti - inflammatory properties .
10414674	2	239	Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate .
10414674	3	313	Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen , 100 mg , three times a day ( ketoprofen group , n = 9 ) or a weak NSAID , acetaminophen , 1 g , three times a day ( acetaminophen group , n = 9 ) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH .
10414674	4	610	Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively .
10414674	5	662	Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first , third , and fifth postoperative mornings .
10414674	6	787	Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen .
10414674	7	907	Aggregation was lower ( P < . 05 ) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day .
10414674	8	1051	In contrast , maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results ( P < . 05 ) .
10414674	9	1235	One patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma .
10414674	10	1320	Coagulation ( prothrombin time [ PT ] , activated partial thromboplastin time [ APPT ] , fibrinogen concentration , and antithrombin III [ AT III ] ) was comparable between the two groups .
10414674	11	1498	Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH .
10414674	12	1580	If ketoprofen is used before surgery on cerebral artery aneurysms , it may pose an additional risk factor for hemorrhage .
10523326	0	0	Nitric oxide synthase expression in the course of lead - induced hypertension .
10523326	1	77	We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites ( NOx ) , and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead - induced hypertension .
10523326	2	294	This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead - induced hypertension is , in part , due to depressed NO synthase ( NOS ) expression .
10523326	3	455	Male Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead - treated group ( given lead acetate , 100 ppm , in drinking water and regular rat chow ) , a group given lead and vitamin E - fortified chow , or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin E - fortified food for 12 weeks .
10523326	4	751	Tail blood pressure , urinary NOx excretion , plasma malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , and endothelial and inducible NOS ( eNOS and iNOS ) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured .
10523326	5	923	The lead - treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma MDA concentration , a fall in urinary NOx excretion , and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression .
10523326	6	1122	Vitamin E supplementation ameliorated hypertension , lowered plasma MDA concentration , and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular , but not renal , tissue eNOS and iNOS expression .
10523326	7	1328	Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure , plasma MDA , or NOS expression in the control group .
10523326	8	1446	The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by lead in cell - free preparations .
10523326	9	1554	In conclusion , lead - induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression .
10523326	10	1705	This is , in part , due to ROS - mediated NO inactivation , lead - associated inhibition of NOS activity , and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension .
10524660	0	0	Glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks of migraine without aura in sufferers of migraine with aura .
10524660	1	97	Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase , thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception .
10524660	2	273	In recent years , increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide ( NO ) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura .
10524660	3	427	In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura , in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN ) ( 0 . 5 microg / kg / min for 20 min ) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura .
10524660	4	674	The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and / or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced .
10524660	5	784	Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls .
10524660	6	830	Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject .
10524660	7	878	Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion ( p = 0 . 037 ) as well as during the following 11 h ( p = 0 . 008 ) .
10524660	8	1041	In the controls , the GTN - induced headache gradually disappeared , whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post - infusion .
10524660	9	1203	At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society .
10524660	10	1359	The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura .
10524660	11	1455	Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals , this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura .
10533019	0	0	Rapid reversal of life - threatening diltiazem - induced tetany with calcium chloride .
10533019	1	83	We describe a patient who developed tetany with sudden respiratory arrest after the infusion of intravenous diltiazem .
10533019	2	202	The administration of calcium chloride rapidly resolved the patient ' s tetany with prompt recovery of respiratory function , averting the need for more aggressive airway management and ventilatory support .
10533019	3	406	The emergency physician should be aware that life - threatening tetany may accompany the administration of intravenous diltiazem and that calcium chloride may be a rapid and effective remedy .
10539815	0	0	Predictors of decreased renal function in patients with heart failure during angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy : results from the studies of left ventricular dysfunction ( SOLVD )
10539815	1	191	BACKGROUND : Although angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , it may also cause decreased renal function .
10539815	2	377	Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication .
10539815	3	478	OBJECTIVE : To quantify specific clinical predictors of reduction in renal function in patients with CHF who are prescribed angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy .
10539815	4	650	METHOD : We analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction ( SOLVD ) , a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF .
10539815	5	825	There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow - up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow - up of 967 days .
10539815	6	999	Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine > / = 0 . 5 mg / dL ( 44 micromol / L ) from baseline .
10539815	7	1110	We used time - to - event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age , baseline ejection fraction , baseline creatinine , low systolic blood pressure ( < 100 mm Hg ) , history of hypertension , diabetes , and use of antiplatelet , diuretic , and beta - blocker therapy .
10539815	8	1406	RESULTS : Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33 % greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls ( P = . 003 ) .
10539815	9	1537	By multivariate analysis , in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age , diuretic therapy , and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function , whereas beta - blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective .
10539815	10	1772	Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups , but significantly more so in the enalapril group ( enalapril : risk ratio [ RR ] 1 . 42 per 10 years , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 32 - 1 . 52 with enalapril ; placebo : RR 1 . 18 , 95 % CI 1 . 12 - 1 . 25 ) .
10539815	11	2060	Diuretic therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of decreased renal function in the enalapril group ( RR 1 . 89 , 95 % CI 1 . 70 - 2 . 08 ) than in the placebo group ( RR 1 . 35 , 95 % CI 1 . 09 - 1 . 66 ) .
10539815	12	2255	Conversely , enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect ( RR 1 . 33 , 95 % CI 1 . 13 - 1 . 53 ) compared with placebo ( RR 1 . 96 , 95 % CI 1 . 57 - 2 . 44 ) in patients with diabetes .
10539815	13	2419	A lower risk of renal impairment was seen in both groups with beta - blocker therapy ( RR 0 . 70 , 95 % CI 0 . 57 - 0 . 85 ) and higher baseline ejection fraction ( RR 0 . 93 per 5 % increment , 95 % CI 0 . 91 - 0 . 96 ) .
10539815	14	2615	CONCLUSIONS : Enalapril use caused a 33 % increase in the risk of decreased renal function in patients with CHF .
10539815	15	2726	Diuretic use and advanced age increased this risk .
10539815	16	2777	Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment in all patients with CHF , but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group . beta - Blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of therapy .
10565806	0	0	Hypomania - like syndrome induced by olanzapine .
10565806	1	47	We report a female patient with a diagnosis of a not otherwise specified psychotic disorder ( DSM - IV ) who developed hypomania shortly after the introduction of olanzapine treatment .
10692744	0	0	Acetazolamide - induced Gerstmann syndrome .
10692744	1	42	Acute confusion induced by acetazolamide is a well known adverse drug reaction in patients with renal impairment .
10692744	2	156	We report a case of acetazolamide - induced Gerstmann syndrome in a patient with normal renal function , to highlight predisposing factors that are frequently overlooked .
10728962	0	0	Vasopressin in the treatment of milrinone - induced hypotension in severe heart failure .
10728962	1	87	The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone in the treatment of severe heart failure is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and hypotension .
10728962	2	260	In patients with decompensated heart failure with hypotension after treatment with milrinone , low doses of vasopressin restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of milrinone .
10743694	0	0	Treatment of tacrolimus - related adverse effects by conversion to cyclosporine in liver transplant recipients .
10743694	1	110	When tacrolimus side effects persist despite dose reduction , conversion to cyclosporine - based immunosuppression ( CyA ) is necessary .
10743694	2	242	We characterized tacrolimus side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug , and outcomes after conversion .
10743694	3	358	Of 388 liver recipients who received tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression , 70 required conversion to CyA .
10743694	4	467	We recorded indication for conversion , whether conversion was early or late after transplantation , tacrolimus dose and trough blood level at conversion , and incidence of rejection after conversion .
10743694	5	665	Conversion was early in 29 patients ( 41 . 4 % ) and late in 41 ( 58 . 6 % ) .
10743694	6	733	Indications for early conversion were neurotoxicity ( 20 ) , ( insulin - dependent ) diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ) ( 5 ) , nephrotoxicity ( 3 ) , gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity ( 6 ) , and cardiomyopathy ( 1 ) , and for late conversion were neurotoxicity ( 15 ) , IDDM ( 12 ) , nephrotoxicity ( 3 ) , GI toxicity ( 5 ) , hepatotoxicity ( 6 ) , post - transplant lmphoproliferate disease ( PTLD ) ( 2 ) , cardiomyopathy ( 1 ) , hemolytic anemia ( 1 ) , and pruritus ( 1 ) .
10743694	7	1151	All early - conversion patients showed improvement / resolution of symptoms .
10743694	8	1224	Among late - conversion patients , 37 ( 90 . 2 % ) had improvement / resolution ; in 4 ( 9 . 8 % ) , adverse effects persisted .
10743694	9	1335	The overall rejection rate was 30 % .
10743694	10	1371	Sixty - two patients ( 88 . 6 % ) are alive with functioning grafts 686 + / - 362 days ( range , 154 - 1433 days ) after conversion .
10743694	11	1490	When tacrolimus side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction , conversion to CyA can be accomplished safely , with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long - term outcome .
1079693	0	0	Ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis .
1079693	1	56	We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years .
1079693	2	137	Thirty - six of the 210 patients ( 17 . 2 % ) developed iridocyclitis .
1079693	3	201	Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients ( 0 to 4 years ) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis .
1079693	4	344	However , 30 % of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age .
1079693	5	414	Although 61 % of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry , 42 % had active uveitis on entry .
1079693	6	519	Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases .
1079693	7	631	Forty - four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms , such as red eye , ocular pain , decreased visual acuity , or photophobia , in order of decreasing frequency .
1079693	8	828	Even after early detection and prompt treatment , 41 % of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics .
1079693	9	1009	Despite this , there was a dramatic decrease in the 50 % incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies .
1079693	10	1137	Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13 % of our group , respectively .
1079693	11	1223	We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs .
1079693	12	1359	Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases ; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found .
1079693	13	1498	Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases .
1079693	14	1574	This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously .
1079693	15	1638	Surgical treatment of cataracts , band keratopathy , and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results .
10840460	0	0	Cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in freely - moving conscious rats : behavioral approach to a new model of visceral pain .
10840460	1	120	PURPOSE : To develop a model of visceral pain in rats using a behavioral approach .
10840460	2	202	Cyclophosphamide ( CP ) , an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite acrolein , was used to induce cystitis .
10840460	3	370	MATERIALS AND METHODS : CP was administered at doses of 50 , 100 and 200 mg . / kg . i . p . to male rats , and their behavior observed and scored .
10840460	4	508	The effects of morphine ( 0 . 5 to 4 mg . / kg . i . v . ) on CP - induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after naloxone ( 1 mg . / kg . s . c . ) .
10840460	5	663	In addition , 90 minutes after CP injection , that is , at the time of administration of morphine , the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination .
10840460	6	826	Finally , to show that the bladder is essential for the CP - induced behavioral modifications , female rats also received CP at doses of 200 mg . / kg . i . p . and of 20 mg . by the intravesical route , and acrolein at doses of 0 . 5 mg . by the intravesical route and of 5 mg . / kg . i . v . RESULTS : CP dose - relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats : breathing rate decrease , closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures .
10840460	7	1261	Morphine dose - dependently reversed these behavioral disorders .
10840460	8	1324	A dose of 0 . 5 mg . / kg . produced a reduction of almost 50 % of the behavioral score induced by CP 200 mg . / kg .
10840460	9	1431	This effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with naloxone .
10840460	10	1499	At the time of administration of morphine , histological modifications of the bladder wall , such as chorionic and muscle layer edema , were observed .
10840460	11	1647	In female rats , CP 200 mg . / kg . i . p . produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats .
10840460	12	1765	Administered at the dose of 20 mg . intravesically , CP did not produce any behavioral effects , whereas acrolein at 0 . 5 mg . intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under CP 200 mg . / kg . i . p . , with the same maximal levels .
10840460	13	2011	Conversely , acrolein 5 mg . / kg . i . v . did not produce any behavioral effects at all .
10840460	14	2094	CONCLUSIONS : Overall , these results indicate that this experimental model of CP - induced cystitis may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory visceral pain , allowing a better understanding of these painful syndromes and thus a better therapeutic approach to them .
10910842	0	0	Prednisolone - induced muscle dysfunction is caused more by atrophy than by altered acetylcholine receptor expression .
10910842	1	117	Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood .
10910842	2	265	We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of prednisolone on muscle function and pharmacology , and their relationship to changes in muscle size and acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) expression .
10910842	3	469	With institutional approval , 35 Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg / kg prednisolone ( P10 group ) , 100 mg / kg prednisolone ( P100 group ) , or an equal volume of saline ( S group ) for 7 days .
10910842	4	707	A fourth group of rats was pair fed ( food restricted ) with the P100 rats for 7 days ( FR group ) .
10910842	5	803	On Day 8 , the nerve - evoked peak twitch tensions , tetanic tensions , and fatigability , and the dose - response curves of d - tubocurarine in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs .
10910842	6	1041	Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P100 , FR , and P10 groups compared with the S group .
10910842	7	1139	Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups .
10910842	8	1219	The evoked peak twitch and tetanic tensions were less in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups , however , tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P100 group than in the S group .
10910842	9	1417	The 50 % effective dose of d - tubocurarine ( microg / kg ) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 ( 33 . 6 + / - 5 . 4 ) than in the S ( 61 . 9 + / - 5 . 0 ) or the P100 ( 71 . 3 + / - 9 . 6 ) groups .
10910842	10	1595	AChR expression was less in the P10 group than in the S group .
10910842	11	1658	The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass ( r ( 2 ) = 0 . 32 , P < 0 . 001 ) , however , not with expression of AChR .
10910842	12	1770	The 50 % effective dose of d - tubocurarine did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression .
10910842	13	1866	Our results suggest that the neuromuscular dysfunction after prednisolone is dose - dependent , and derives primarily from muscle atrophy and derives less so from changes in AChR expression .
10910842	14	2054	IMPLICATIONS : The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear .
10910842	15	2185	We suggest that the observed effects are dose - dependent and derive primarily from muscle atrophy and derive less from changes in acetylcholine receptor expression .

11009181	2	159	While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951 , the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson ' s disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study .
11009181	3	397	A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off - periods even in patients with complex on - off motor swings .
11009181	4	721	Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off - time by more than 50 % in this group of patients , which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add - on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors .
11009181	5	968	Extended follow - up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long - term persistence of apomorphine efficacy .
11009181	6	1077	In addition , there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa - induced dyskinesias .
11009181	7	1278	The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems , whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role .
11009181	8	1453	Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson ' s disease , this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use .
11022397	0	0	Probing peripheral and central cholinergic system responses .
11022397	1	61	OBJECTIVE : The pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as Alzheimer ' s disease , yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied .
11022397	2	361	This study assessed the effect of normal aging on ( 1 ) the tropicamide - induced increase in pupil diameter , and ( 2 ) the reversal of this effect with pilocarpine .
11022397	3	521	Scopolamine was used as a positive control to detect age - dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly .
11022397	4	647	DESIGN : Randomized double - blind controlled trial .
11022397	5	697	PARTICIPANTS : Ten healthy elderly ( mean age 70 ) and 9 young ( mean age 33 ) volunteers .
11022397	6	783	INTERVENTIONS : Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours .
11022397	7	884	The study involved 4 sessions .
11022397	8	915	In 1 session , tropicamide ( 20 microL , 0 . 01 % ) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other .
11022397	9	1014	In another session , tropicamide ( 20 microL , 0 . 01 % ) was administered to both eyes , followed 23 minutes later by the application of pilocarpine ( 20 microL , 0 . 1 % ) to one eye and placebo to the other .
11022397	10	1211	All eye drops were given in a randomized order .
11022397	11	1259	In 2 separate sessions , a single dose of scopolamine ( 0 . 5 mg , intravenously ) or placebo was administered , and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours .
11022397	12	1467	OUTCOME MEASURES : Pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine ; scopolamine - induced impairment in word recall .
11022397	13	1611	RESULTS : There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to tropicamide at any time point ( p > 0 . 05 ) .
11022397	14	1760	The elderly group had a significantly greater pilocarpine - induced net decrease in pupil size 85 , 125 , 165 and 215 minutes after administration , compared with the young group ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
11022397	15	1946	Compared with the young group , the elderly group had greater scopolamine - induced impairment in word recall 60 , 90 and 120 minutes after administration ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
11022397	16	2109	CONCLUSION : There is an age - related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with tropicamide .
11022397	17	2215	Thus , pilocarpine may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients .
11027904	0	0	Pain responses in methadone - maintained opioid abusers .
11027904	1	55	Providing pain management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task , in part because little is known about their pain experience and analgesic requirements .
11027904	2	226	This study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in methadone - maintenance ( MM ) treatment ( n = 60 ) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects ( n = 60 ) .
11027904	3	455	By using a placebo - controlled , two - way factorial design , tolerance to cold - pressor ( CP ) pain was examined , both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid ( hydromorphone 2 mg ) and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory ( ketorolac 10 mg ) analgesic agents .
11027904	4	734	Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP pain than control subjects , replicating previous work .
11027904	5	863	Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group .
11027904	6	932	These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a pain - intolerant subset of clinical patients .
11027904	7	1032	Their complaints of pain should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively .
11058428	0	0	High - dose methylprednisolone may do more harm for spinal cord injury .
11058428	1	70	Because of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies ( NASCIS ) , high - dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute spinal cord injury .
11058428	2	228	In the NASCIS , there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high - dose methylprednisolone may cause .
11058428	3	368	The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2 - day period for any clinical condition .
11058428	4	527	We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients .
11058428	5	618	Further , steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy , instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury .
11058428	6	882	To our knowledge , this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by NASCIS may cause acute corticosteroid myopathy .
11063349	0	0	Conversion to rapamycin immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients : report of an initial experience .
11063349	1	107	BACKGROUND : The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of RAPA conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine ( CsA ) or tacrolimus ( Tac ) toxicity .
11063349	2	259	METHODS : Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin ( RAPA ) ( 5 mg / day ) 0 to 204 months posttransplant .
11063349	3	391	Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses .
11063349	4	447	The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity ( 12 ) , acute CsA or Tac toxicity ( 3 ) , severe facial dysmorphism ( 2 ) , posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) in remission ( 2 ) , and hepatotoxicity in 1 .
11063349	5	675	Follow - up is 7 to 24 months .
11063349	6	704	RESULTS : In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [ 233 + / - 34 to 210 + / - 56 micromol / liter ( P < 0 . 05 ) at 6 months ] .
11063349	7	888	Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients .
11063349	8	933	No relapse of PTLD was observed .
11063349	9	966	Five patients developed pneumonia ( two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate ) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans .
11063349	10	1142	There were no deaths .
11063349	11	1164	RAPA was discontinued in four patients , because of pneumonia in two , PTLD in one , and oral aphtous ulcers in one .
11063349	12	1278	RAPA levels were high ( > 15 ng / ml ) in 7 of 13 ( 54 % ) patients .
11063349	13	1339	CONCLUSIONS : RAPA conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal .
11063349	14	1430	However , when converting patients to RAPA drug levels should be monitored to avoid over - immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given .
11077455	0	0	Electro - oculography , electroretinography , visual evoked potentials , and multifocal electroretinography in patients with vigabatrin - attributed visual field constriction .
11077455	1	169	PURPOSE : Symptomatic visual field constriction thought to be associated with vigabatrin has been reported .
11077455	2	276	The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin - attributed visual field loss , three of whom were reported previously .
11077455	3	464	Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin .
11077455	4	521	METHODS : The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer .
11077455	5	619	Full visual electrophysiology , including flash electroretinography ( ERG ) , pattern electroretinography , multifocal ERG using the VERIS system , electro - oculography , and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials , was undertaken .
11077455	6	846	RESULTS : Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field .
11077455	7	958	The eighth exhibited concentric constriction .
11077455	8	1004	Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits ; two patients had subnormal Arden electro - oculography indices ; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave .
11077455	9	1204	However , five patients showed delayed 30 - Hz flicker b waves , and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials .
11077455	10	1323	Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level .
11077455	11	1478	CONCLUSION : Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy .
11077455	12	1573	The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when vigabatrin therapy is withdrawn .
11078231	0	0	Myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm during dobutamine stress echocardiography .
11078231	1	92	Dobutamine stress echocardiography ( DSE ) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischemia .
11078231	2	196	Until now , the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery , and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery stenosis .
11078231	3	375	The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by dobutamine .
11078231	4	494	We performed DSE on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis .
11078231	5	611	All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram ( variant angina ) .
11078231	6	713	Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine , and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients .
11078231	7	869	DSE was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 microg / kg / min every 5 minutes .
11078231	8	1006	Of the 51 patients , 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation .
11078231	9	1072	All 7 patients ( 13 . 7 % ) had chest pain during asynergy , and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy .
11078231	10	1207	These findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic angina .
11078231	11	1321	When DSE is performed to evaluate coronary artery disease , not only fixed coronary stenosis , but also coronary spasm should be considered as a genesis of asynergy .
11079278	0	0	Effect of intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus glucagon on dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia .
11079278	1	116	STUDY OBJECTIVE : To determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing with technetium - 99m sestamibi single - photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST - segment monitoring , and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol ' s effects .
11079278	2	382	DESIGN : Randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial .
11079278	3	442	SETTING : Community hospital .
11079278	4	471	PATIENTS : Twenty - two patients with known reversible perfusion defects .
11079278	5	542	INTERVENTION : Patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol .
11079278	6	622	Before dobutamine was begun , no therapy was given during the first visit , and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg .
11079278	7	802	Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats / minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg .
11079278	8	929	MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31 % , summed stress scores 29 % , and summed difference scores 43 % versus control .
11079278	9	1078	Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29 % versus control .
11079278	10	1159	Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced , although they were 18 % and 30 % lower , respectively , than control .
11079278	11	1300	No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol - glucagon .
11079278	12	1399	CONCLUSION : During dobutamine stress testing , metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia .
11079278	13	1514	Glucagon 1 mg , although somewhat effective , does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically .
11099450	0	0	Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy .
11099450	1	70	The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian ' off ' signs and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LID ) .
11099450	2	292	We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests ( Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations ) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery , whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID .
11099450	3	657	We also found a highly significant correlation ( P : < 0 . 0001 , r = 0 . 8 ) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in LID in the contralateral limbs , whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian ' off ' signs .
11099450	4	943	The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian ' off ' signs .
11099450	5	1092	The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian ' off ' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and dyskinesias .
11099450	6	1458	Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism , the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID .
11099450	7	1600	We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias , especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy .
11099450	8	1822	The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms , and hence could be variable .
11185967	0	0	Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department seizure patients .
11185967	1	76	OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patients .
11185967	2	256	METHODS : This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation .
11185967	3	408	Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine using enzyme - mediated immunoassay methodology .
11185967	4	532	Plasma samples with benzoylecgonine greater than 150 ng / mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng / mL were defined as positive .
11185967	5	658	Patient demographics , history of underlying drug or alcohol - related seizure disorder , estimated time from seizure to sample collection , history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse , results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse , and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers .
11185967	6	963	RESULTS : Fourteen of 248 ( 5 . 6 % , 95 % CI 2 . 7 % - 8 . 5 % ) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoylecgonine and no samples ( 0 % , 95 % CI 0 - 1 . 2 % ) were positive for amphetamine .
11185967	7	1151	Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse ( p < 0 . 0005 ) .
11185967	8	1293	CONCLUSIONS : During this study period , routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield .
11185967	9	1429	As a result , routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population .
11195262	0	0	Contribution of sodium valproate to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone .
11195262	1	101	We report the case of a 62 - year - old man who was administered sodium valproate ( VPA ) and who subsequently developed the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone ( SIADH ) .
11195262	2	289	He had been taking VPA for treatment of idiopathic generalized tonic - clonic convulsions since he was 56 years old .
11195262	3	404	After substituting VPA with zonisamide , the serum sodium level returned to normal .
11195262	4	487	We consider this episode of SIADH to be the result of a combination of factors including a weakness of the central nervous system and the long - term administration of VPA .
11208990	0	0	Association of nitric oxide production and apoptosis in a model of experimental nephropathy .
11208990	1	93	BACKGROUND : In recent studies increased amounts of nitric oxide ( NO ) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney .
11208990	2	247	We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin ( ADR ) .
11208990	3	411	METHODS : The alteration in the NO pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum / urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney ( IPRK ) system .
11208990	4	613	Rats were stratified into control groups and ADR - induced nephropathy groups .
11208990	5	690	These two groups were then divided into : group 1 , animals receiving saline ; and group 2 , animals receiving aminoguanidine ( AG ) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible - NO synthase .
11208990	6	873	On day 21 , rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis .
11208990	7	956	RESULTS : Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with ADR revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation .
11208990	8	1125	They also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
11208990	9	1237	Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ADR - nephropathy group ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
11208990	10	1328	In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the ADR - nephropathy group .
11208990	11	1448	Apoptosis was not detected in controls .
11208990	12	1488	However , in the ADR - nephropathy group , numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas .
11208990	13	1601	Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1 , a marker for monocytes / macrophages .
11208990	14	1718	Treatment with AG prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control levels .
11208990	15	1864	CONCLUSION : We suggest that interactions between NO and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the ADR - induced nephrosis .
11226639	0	0	Dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate - induced narcosis in rats .
11226639	1	67	Melatonin affects the circadian sleep / wake cycle , but it is not clear whether it may influence drug - induced narcosis .
11226639	2	185	Sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre - treated with melatonin ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 , 5 and 50 mg / kg ) .
11226639	3	310	Melatonin pre - treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis , however , no dose - effect correlation was found .
11226639	4	429	In particular , low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis .
11226639	5	529	In contrast , the highest dose of melatonin ( 50 mg / kg ) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis , and a reduction in mortality rate .
11226639	6	727	Melatonin 0 . 5 and 5 mg / kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine - or diazepam - induced narcosis .
11226639	7	840	Thus , the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological narcosis seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action .
11230490	0	0	Reduced cardiotoxicity and preserved antitumor efficacy of liposome - encapsulated doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide compared with conventional doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in a randomized , multicenter trial of metastatic breast cancer .
11230490	1	238	PURPOSE : To determine whether Myocet ( liposome - encapsulated doxorubicin ; The Liposome Company , Elan Corporation , Princeton , NJ ) in combination with cyclophosphamide significantly reduces doxorubicin cardiotoxicity while providing comparable antitumor efficacy in first - line treatment of metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) .
11230490	2	557	PATIENTS AND METHODS : Two hundred ninety - seven patients with MBC and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg / m ( 2 ) of Myocet ( M ) or conventional doxorubicin ( A ) , in combination with 600 mg / m ( 2 ) of cyclophosphamide ( C ) , every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
11230490	3	886	Cardiotoxicity was defined by reductions in left - ventricular ejection fraction , assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans , or congestive heart failure ( CHF ) .
11230490	4	1063	Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective tumor response rates ( World Health Organization criteria ) , time to progression , and survival .
11230490	5	1202	RESULTS : Six percent of MC patients versus 21 % ( including five cases of CHF ) of AC patients developed cardiotoxicity ( P = . 0002 ) .
11230490	6	1331	Median cumulative doxorubicin dose at onset was more than 2 , 220 mg / m ( 2 ) for MC versus 480 mg / m ( 2 ) for AC ( P = . 0001 , hazard ratio , 5 . 04 ) .
11230490	7	1468	MC patients also experienced less grade 4 neutropenia .
11230490	8	1523	Antitumor efficacy of MC versus AC was comparable : objective response rates , 43 % versus 43 % ; median time to progression , 5 . 1 % versus 5 . 5 months ; median time to treatment failure , 4 . 6 versus 4 . 4 months ; and median survival , 19 versus 16 months .
11230490	9	1767	CONCLUSION : Myocet improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by significantly reducing cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy , when used in combination with cyclophosphamide as first - line therapy for MBC .
11243580	0	0	The role of nitrergic system in lidocaine - induced convulsion in the mouse .
11243580	1	75	The effects of N - nitro - L - arginine - methyl ester ( L - NAME ) a nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase inhibitor and L - arginine , a NO precursor , were investigated on lidocaine - induced convulsions .
11243580	2	254	In the first experiment , four groups of mice received physiological saline ( 0 . 9 % ) , L - arginine ( 300 mg / kg , i . p . ) , L - NAME ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) and diazepam ( 2 mg / kg ) , respectively .
11243580	3	430	Thirty minutes after these injections , all mice received lidocaine ( 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
11243580	4	515	In the second experiment , four groups of mice received similar treatment in the first experiment , and 30 min after these injections , all mice received a higher dose of lidocaine ( 80 mg / kg ) .
11243580	5	705	L - NAME ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) and diazepam ( 2 mg / kg ) significantly decreased the incidence of lidocaine ( 50 mg / kg ) - induced convulsions .
11243580	6	836	In contrast , the L - arginine treatment increased the incidence of lidocaine ( 80 mg / kg , i . p . ) - induced convulsions significantly .
11243580	7	963	These results may suggest that NO is a proconvulsant mediator in lidocaine - induced convulsions .
11245434	0	0	Erythropoietin restores the anemia - induced reduction in cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in rat tumors .
11245434	1	101	The aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin ( rHuEPO ) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental tumors .
11245434	2	295	Anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin ( 50 mg / kg i . v . ) resulting in a long - lasting reduction ( 30 % ) of the hemoglobin concentration .
11245434	3	442	In a second group , the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO ( 1000 IU / kg ) administered s . c . three times / week starting 7 days before carboplatin application .
11245434	4	607	Four days after carboplatin treatment , tumors ( DS - sarcoma of the rat ) were implanted s . c . onto the hind food dorsum .
11245434	5	724	Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se .
11245434	6	802	When tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg / kg i . p . ) 5 days after implantation , a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed .
11245434	7	979	In the anemia group , the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days versus 8 . 6 days ) .
11245434	8	1105	In the group where anemia was prevented by rHuEPO treatment , growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days ) .
11245434	9	1239	These results suggest that chemotherapy - induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors , whereas correction of anemia by rHuEPO treatment ( epoetin alpha ) increases the sensitivity , probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue .
11271907	0	0	Fatal haemorrhagic myocarditis secondary to cyclophosphamide therapy .
11271907	1	70	Haemorrhagic myocarditis is a rare but important complication of cyclophosphamide therapy .
11271907	2	161	Echocardiographic identification of the disorder can be made .
11271907	3	223	We believe that the ultrasound features of this disorder have not been previously reported .
11282081	0	0	Effects of verapamil on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs .
11282081	1	95	BACKGROUND : Atrial tachycardia - induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and decreases L - type Ca ( 2 + ) current .
11282081	2	250	There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L - type Ca ( 2 ) channel blockade can promote AF , consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca ( 2 + ) channel inhibition .
11282081	3	412	METHODS : To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca ( 2 + ) channel blockers , we administered verapamil to morphine - chloralose anesthetized dogs .
11282081	4	570	Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nadolol was applied in some experiments .
11282081	5	692	Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during AF .
11282081	6	785	RESULTS : Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs , increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing , from 8 + / - 4 s ( mean + / - S . E . ) to 95 + / - 39 s ( P < 0 . 01 vs . control ) at a loading dose of 0 . 1 mg / kg and 228 + / - 101 s ( P < 0 . 0005 vs . control ) at a dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg .
11282081	7	1048	Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil .
11282081	8	1216	In these experiments , verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period ( ERP ) from 122 + / - 5 to 114 + / - 4 ms ( P < 0 . 02 ) at a cycle length of 300 ms , decreased ERP heterogeneity ( from 15 + / - 1 to 10 + / - 1 % , P < 0 . 05 ) , heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF ( 94 + / - 4 to 84 + / - 3 ms , P < 0 . 005 ) .
11282081	9	1539	Diltiazem did not affect ERP , AF cycle length or AF duration , but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil ( n = 5 ) .
11282081	10	1681	In the presence of autonomic blockade , verapamil failed to promote AF and increased , rather than decreasing , refractoriness .
11282081	11	1806	Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade .
11282081	12	1904	Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle .
11282081	13	2071	CONCLUSIONS : Verapamil promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry , an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem .
11284996	0	0	Calcitonin gene - related peptide levels during nitric oxide - induced headache in patients with chronic tension - type headache .
11284996	1	124	It has been proposed that nitric oxide ( NO ) induced headache in primary headaches may be associated with release of calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) .
11284996	2	280	In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during headache induced by the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN ) in 16 patients with chronic tension - type headache and 16 healthy controls .
11284996	3	488	The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0 . 5 microg / kg / min GTN or placebo over 20 min on two headache - free days .
11284996	4	608	Blood samples were collected at baseline , 10 , 20 and 60 min after start of infusion .
11284996	5	693	Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate headache on the GTN day than on the placebo day and the headache was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls .
11284996	6	892	There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve ( AUCCGRP ) on GTN vs . placebo day in either patients ( P = 0 . 65 ) or controls ( P = 0 . 48 ) .
11284996	7	1037	The AUCCGRP recorded on the GTN day did not differ between patients and controls ( P = 0 . 36 ) .
11284996	8	1128	Both in patients and controls , CGRP levels changed significantly over time , on both the GTN and placebo days ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
11284996	9	1249	The present study indicates that NO - induced immediate headache is not associated with release of CGRP .
11302406	0	0	Fluconazole - induced torsade de pointes .
11302406	1	40	OBJECTIVE : To present a case of fluconazole - associated torsade de pointes ( TDP ) and discuss fluconazole ' s role in causing TDP .
11302406	2	167	CASE SUMMARY : A 68 - year - old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed TDP eight days after commencing oral fluconazole The patient had no other risk factors for TDP , including coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy , congestive heart failure , and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of fluconazole and TDP .
11302406	3	556	The TDP resolved when fluconazole was discontinued ; however , the patient continued to have premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ( NSVT ) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION : Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of TDP .
11302406	4	908	The possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents .
11302406	5	1005	In our patient , there was no other etiology identified that could explain QT prolongation or TDP The complete disappearance of NSVT and premature ventricular contractions followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology .
11302406	6	1291	CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware that fluconazole , even at low doses , may cause prolongation of the QT interval , leading to TDP .
11302406	7	1427	Serial electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered when fluconazole is administered in patients who are at risk for ventricular arrhythmias .
11337188	0	0	Cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis associated with oxacillin .
11337188	1	65	A 67 - year - old man who was treated with oxacillin for one week because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia , developed renal failure and diffuse , symmetric , palpable purpuric lesions on his feet .
11337188	2	259	Necrotic blisters were noted on his fingers .
11337188	3	304	Skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of leucocytoclastic vasculitis .
11337188	4	377	Oxacillin was discontinued and patient was treated with corticosteroids .
11337188	5	450	The rash disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal .
11337188	6	528	Leucocytoclastic vasculitis presents as palpable purpura of the lower extremities often accompanied by abdominal pain , arthralgia , and renal involvement .
11337188	7	682	Etiologic factors or associated disorders include infections , medications , collagen vascular disease and neoplasia .
11337188	8	798	However , in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified .
11337188	9	863	Usually it is a self - limited disorder , but corticosteroid therapy may be needed in life - threatening cases since early treatment with corticosteroids in severe cases can prevent complications .
11337188	10	1055	Oxacillin should be included among the drugs that can cause leucocytoclastic vasculitis .
1141447	0	0	The renal pathology in a case of lithium - induced diabetes insipidus .
1141447	1	69	A case of lithium - induced diabetes insipidus is reported .
1141447	2	127	At necropsy microscopy shoed unique and extensive damage to cells lining the distal nephron .
1141447	3	220	It is suggested that these changes represent a specific toxic effect of lithium , reported here for the first time in man .
11467664	0	0	Cholestatic jaundice associated with the use of metformin .
11467664	1	59	We report a patient who developed cholestatic jaundice shortly after initiation of treatment with metformin hydrochloride .
11467664	2	182	Ultrasound of the liver and abdominal CT were normal .
11467664	3	236	An ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy .
11467664	4	275	A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked cholestasis , with portal edema , ductular proliferation , and acute inflammation .
11467664	5	411	Metformin hydrochloride was discontinued , and the patient ' s jaundice resolved slowly over a period of several months .
11467664	6	529	Given the onset of his jaundice 2 wk after the initiation of metformin , we believe that this case represents an example of metformin - associated hepatotoxicity , the first such case reported .
11524350	0	0	Systemic toxicity and resuscitation in bupivacaine - , levobupivacaine - , or ropivacaine - infused rats .
11524350	1	100	We compared the systemic toxicity of bupivacaine , levobupivacaine , and ropivacaine in anesthetized rats .
11524350	2	205	We also compared the ability to resuscitate rats after lethal doses of these local anesthetics .
11524350	3	301	Bupivacaine , levobupivacaine , or ropivacaine was infused at a rate of 2 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . min ( - 1 ) while electrocardiogram , electroencephalogram , and arterial pressure were continuously monitored .
11524350	4	491	When asystole was recorded , drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was begun .
11524350	5	585	Epinephrine 0 . 01 mg / kg was administered at 1 - min intervals while external cardiac compressions were applied .
11524350	6	694	Resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure > or = 100 mm Hg was achieved within 5 min .
11524350	7	811	The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine that produced seizures were similar and were larger than those of bupivacaine .
11524350	8	946	The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine that produced dysrhythmias and asystole were smaller than the corresponding doses of ropivacaine , but they were larger than those of bupivacaine .
11524350	9	1132	The number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups .
11524350	10	1201	However , a smaller dose of epinephrine was required in the Ropivacaine group than in the other groups .
11524350	11	1304	We conclude that the systemic toxicity of levobupivacaine is intermediate between that of ropivacaine and bupivacaine when administered at the same rate and that ropivacaine - induced cardiac arrest appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by bupivacaine or levobupivacaine .
11573852	0	0	Amphotericin B - induced seizures in a patient with AIDS .
11573852	1	56	OBJECTIVE : To report a case of multiple episodes of seizure activity in an AIDS patent following amphotericin B infusion .
11573852	2	178	CASE SUMMARY : A 46 - year - old African - American man experienced recurrent grand mal seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B , then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time .
11573852	3	416	The patients concurrent medications included didanosine , hydroxyzine , promethazine , hydrocortisone , and prochlorperazine .
11573852	4	538	Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam , the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration .
11573852	5	667	DISCUSSION : AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis , both of which the patient had , can potentially cause seizures .
11573852	6	776	The patient had a history of alcohol abuse ; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures .
11573852	7	882	Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures .
11573852	8	937	However , these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out .
11573852	9	1002	The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient .
11573852	10	1110	CONCLUSIONS : Amphotericin B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures .
11573852	11	1186	To date , only three cases of seizures associated with amphotericin B have been reported in the literature , but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect .
11583940	0	0	Sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for calcineurin - free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
11583940	1	107	Calcineurin inhibitors , such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus , have been available for almost 20 years .
11583940	2	209	Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression , they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity .
11583940	3	370	Acute nephrotoxicity , which occurs in the early period after transplantation , leads to a higher rate of dialysis , and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss .
11583940	4	548	Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases .
11583940	5	667	Two recently available immunosuppressive agents , mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus ( rapamycin ) , have no nephrotoxicity .
11583940	6	789	The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy .
11583940	7	919	This paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
11694026	0	0	Tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients with NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema .
11694026	1	96	Previous studies evaluated the tolerance of nimesulide and paracetamol in subjects with cutaneous , respiratory and anaphylactoid reactions induced by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
11694026	2	293	In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of nimesulide and paracetamol in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well - documented history of NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema .
11694026	3	498	Furthermore , we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to paracetamol and nimesulide .
11694026	4	628	A single - placebo - controlled oral challenge procedure with nimesulide or paracetamol was applied to 829 patients with a history of NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema .
11694026	5	794	A total of 75 / 829 ( 9 . 4 % ) patients experienced reactions to nimesulide or paracetamol .
11694026	6	880	Of the 715 patients tested with nimesulide 62 ( 8 . 6 % ) showed a positive test , while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with paracetamol , 13 ( 9 . 6 % ) did not tolerate this drug .
11694026	7	1062	Furthermore , 18 . 28 % of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11 . 8 % of subjects with an history of NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema or angioedema alone ( with or without chronic urticaria ) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs .
11694026	8	1310	Taken together , our results confirm the good tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients who experienced urticaria / angioedema caused by NSAIDs .
11694026	9	1465	However , the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic urticaria and , above all , by a history of NSAID - induced angioedema .
11704023	0	0	Comparison of aqueous and gellan ophthalmic timolol with placebo on the 24 - hour heart rate response in patients on treatment for glaucoma .
11704023	1	139	PURPOSE : Topical beta - blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with glaucoma .
11704023	2	243	Therapy results in systemic absorption , however , the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified .
11704023	3	372	DESIGN : This trial evaluated the effect of placebo , 0 . 5 % aqueous timolol ( timolol solution ) and a 0 . 5 % timolol suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva ( timolol gellan ) on the 24 - hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for glaucoma to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate .
11704023	4	683	METHODS : Forty - three Caucasian patients with primary open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a mean ( + / - SD ) age of 63 ( + / - 8 ) years were randomized and crossed over in a double - masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo ( morning and evening in both eyes ) , timolol solution ( morning and evening in both eyes ) , or timolol gellan ( morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening ) .
11704023	5	1077	On the 13th day of each period , heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical , ambulant 24 - hour period .
11704023	6	1189	RESULTS : Both timolol solution and timolol gellan reduced the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo ( P < or = . 001 ) , and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime ( - 7 . 5 % change in mean heart rate , - 5 . 7 beats / min ) .
11704023	7	1423	Timolol gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24 - hour heart rate , compared with timolol solution .
11704023	8	1554	During the night , the mean 12 - hour heart rate on placebo and timolol gellan were both significantly less than on timolol solution ; the difference between solution and gellan treatments was statistically significant ( P = . 01 ) .
11704023	9	1780	CONCLUSIONS : Both timolol solution and timolol gellan decrease the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo .
11704023	10	1894	This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period .
11704023	11	1962	These data quantify the modest bradycardia associated with ophthalmic beta - blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for glaucoma .
11704023	12	2110	Although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial , reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences .
11705128	0	0	Management strategies for ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia in the treatment of hepatitis C : clinical and economic implications .
11705128	1	130	OBJECTIVES : Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost - effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha - 2b / ribavirin compared with interferon - alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) .
11705128	2	381	Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect : ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia ( RIHA ) .
11705128	3	502	The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health - care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting .
11705128	4	651	METHODS : A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of RIHA .
11705128	5	772	Decision - analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating RIHA .
11705128	6	850	Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses .
11705128	7	904	RESULTS : RIHA , defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g / L , occurs in approximately 7 % to 9 % of patients treated with combination therapy .
11705128	8	1057	The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage .
11705128	9	1158	We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48 - week treatment course ( range 68 - 692 ) .
11705128	10	1327	The results of the one - way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 317 .
11705128	11	1400	In comparison , the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16 , 459 .
11705128	12	1471	CONCLUSIONS : The direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA is 1 % ( 170 / 16 , 459 ) of drug treatment costs .
11705128	13	1586	Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of RIHA in a real - world population .
11705128	14	1693	Despite these uncertainties , this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating RIHA provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect .
11752998	0	0	Preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an American formulation of adenosine in humans .
11752998	1	108	BACKGROUND : Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans , and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation .
11752998	2	434	The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US , using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin - evoked mechanical hypersensitivity .
11752998	3	634	METHODS : Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent , 65 volunteers were studied in two trials : an open - label , dose - escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0 . 25 - 2 . 0 mg and a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of adenosine , 2 mg .
11752998	4	944	Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis , and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined .
11752998	5	1164	RESULTS : Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h .
11752998	6	1372	In contrast , residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short ( < 4 h ) .
11752998	7	1455	CONCLUSIONS : These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity , presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection .
11752998	8	1644	The long - lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid .
11827497	0	0	Delayed - onset heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .
11827497	1	48	BACKGROUND : Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure , with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli .
11827497	2	189	Delayed recognition and treatment of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes .
11827497	3	296	OBJECTIVE : To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia are delayed .
11827497	4	451	DESIGN : Retrospective case series .
11827497	5	486	SETTING : Three large urban hospitals ( with active cardiovascular surgery programs ) .
11827497	6	570	PATIENTS : 14 patients seen over a 3 - year period in whom heparin - induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications .
11827497	7	734	MEASUREMENTS : Platelet counts , onset of objectively determined thromboembolism , results of heparin - induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests , and outcomes .
11827497	8	889	RESULTS : Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure - - in most cases , with no thrombocytopenia recognized - - only to return to the hospital ( median , day 14 ) with thromboembolic complications .
11827497	9	1111	Thromboemboli were venous ( 12 patients , 7 with pulmonary emboli ) or arterial ( 4 patients ) or both .
11827497	10	1210	Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation .
11827497	11	1294	On readmission , 11 patients received therapeutic heparin , which worsened the patients ' clinical condition and , in all 11 cases , decreased the platelet count ( mean at readmission , 143 x 10 ( 9 ) cells / L ; mean nadir after heparin re - exposure , 39 x 10 ( 9 ) cells / L ) .
11827497	12	1553	Results of serologic tests for heparin - induced antibodies were positive in all patients .
11827497	13	1642	Subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants ( 11 patients ) , thrombolytic drugs ( 3 patients ) , inferior vena cava filters ( 3 patients ) and , eventually , warfarin ( 11 patients ) .
11827497	14	1829	Three patients died .
11827497	15	1850	CONCLUSIONS : Delayed - onset heparin - induced thrombocytopenia is increasingly being recognized .
11827497	16	1944	To avoid disastrous outcomes , physicians must consider heparin - induced thrombocytopenia whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with thromboembolism ; therapy with alternative anticoagulants , not heparin , should be initiated .
11838826	0	0	Treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia with a dopamine agonist in children .
11838826	1	89	BACKGROUND : Risperidone , a potent antagonist of both serotonergic ( 5HT2A ) and dopaminergic D2 receptors is associated with hyperprolactinemia in adults and children .
11838826	2	255	Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with prolactinomas may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either delayed puberty or short stature .
11838826	3	433	These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug - induced hyperprolactinemia in youth .
11838826	4	564	We report the successful treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia with cabergoline in youth .
11838826	5	668	METHODS : We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia treated with cabergoline .
11838826	6	805	RESULTS : Four males ( age 6 - 11 years ) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( fourth edition ) bipolar disorder or psychoses , with risperidone - induced elevations in serum prolactin levels ( 57 . 5 - 129 ng / mL , normal 5 - 15 ng / mL ) , were treated with cabergoline ( mean dose 2 . 13 + / - 0 . 09 mg / week ) .
11838826	7	1113	When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects ( mean 11 . 2 + / - 10 . 9 ng / mL ) , the cabergoline dose was reduced to 1 mg / week in three of four subjects .
11838826	8	1274	The mean duration of therapy with cabergoline was 523 . 5 + / - 129 . 7 days , and the mean duration of therapy with risperidone was 788 . 5 + / - 162 . 5 days .
11838826	9	1422	Cabergoline was well tolerated without adverse effects .
11838826	10	1478	CONCLUSIONS : Cabergoline may be useful for the treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia in youth ; however , further research is needed .
11847945	0	0	Acute cholestatic hepatitis after exposure to isoflurane .
11847945	1	58	OBJECTIVE : To report a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane .
11847945	2	179	CASE SUMMARY : A 70 - year - old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute cholestatic hepatitis 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia .
11847945	3	346	There was no evidence for viral , autoimmune , or metabolic causes of hepatitis .
11847945	4	425	No other medications were involved except for dipyrone for analgesia .
11847945	5	495	The alanine aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U / L and the serum bilirubin reached a peak of 17 . 0 mg / dL .
11847945	6	627	There was slow improvement over 4 months .
11847945	7	669	Accidental reexposure by the patient to dipyrone was uneventful .
11847945	8	734	DISCUSSION : The clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles halothane hepatitis , which has a significant mortality rate .
11847945	9	866	CONCLUSIONS : Isoflurane , a common anesthetic agent , can cause severe cholestatic hepatitis .
11858397	0	0	Torsade de pointes induced by metoclopramide in an elderly woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block .
11858397	1	117	There is a growing list of drugs implicated in acquired long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes .
11858397	2	214	However , the torsadogenic potential of metoclopramide , a commonly used antiemetic and prokinetic drug , has not been reported in the literature , despite its chemical similarity to procainamide .
11858397	3	407	We report on a 92 - year - old woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block who developed torsade de pointes after intravenous and oral administration of metoclopramide .
11858397	4	585	This patient also developed torsade de pointes when cisapride and erythromycin were given simultaneously .
11858397	5	691	These two episodes were suppressed successfully after discontinuing the offending drugs and administering class IB drugs .
11858397	6	813	This is the first documentation that metoclopramide provokes torsade de pointes clinically .
11858397	7	905	Metoclopramide should be used cautiously in patients with a risk of torsade de pointes .
11860278	0	0	Dopamine D2 receptor signaling controls neuronal cell death induced by muscarinic and glutamatergic drugs .
11860278	1	107	Dopamine ( DA ) , through D1 / D2 receptor - mediated signaling , plays a major role in the control of epileptic seizures arising in the limbic system .
11860278	2	251	Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level .
11860278	3	377	In this respect , little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy - induced neuronal cell death .
11860278	4	500	Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R - / - mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine .
11860278	5	627	We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid ( KA ) , a potent glutamate agonist .
11860278	6	735	Importantly , D2R - / - mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity .
11860278	7	879	However , pilocarpine - induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R - / - brains in comparison to KA .
11860278	8	1011	Thus , the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine .
11860278	9	1115	Moreover , the dopaminergic control of epilepsy - induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters .
11860495	0	0	Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti - amnesic effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats .
11860495	1	148	Pregnenolone sulphate ( PREGS ) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory - enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies , with particular importance in the ageing process .
11860495	2	351	The mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems .
11860495	3	499	This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( NMDARs ) and a negative modulator of gamma - aminobutyric acid ( A ) receptors ( GABA ( A ) Rs ) .
11860495	4	698	Moreover , PREGS is able to reverse the amnesic - like effects of NMDAR and GABA ( A ) R ligands .
11860495	5	789	To investigate this hypothesis , the present study in rats examined the memory - altering abilities of structural analogs of PREGS , which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and / or GABA ( A ) R function .
11860495	6	986	The analogs tested were : 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate ( an agent that is inactive at GABA ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) , epipregnanolone ( [ 3beta - hydroxy - 5beta - pregnan - 20 - one ] sulphate , an inhibitor of both GABA ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) , and a newly synthesized ( - ) PREGS enantiomer ( which is identical to PREGS in effects on GABA ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) .
11860495	7	1312	The memory - enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine - induced amnesia .
11860495	8	1456	Both PREGS and its ( - ) enantiomer blocked the effects of scopolamine .
11860495	9	1526	The results show that , unlike PREGS , 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine , suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory - enhancing effects of PREGS .
11860495	10	1772	Moreover , enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine - induced amnesia .
11860495	11	1965	These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive steroids .
11861791	0	0	Activation of poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase contributes to development of doxorubicin - induced heart failure .
11861791	1	107	Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) by oxidant - mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress .
11861791	2	316	Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin ( DOX ) , a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic .
11861791	3	466	Thus , we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the DOX - induced cardiotoxicity .
11861791	4	566	Using a dual approach of PARP - 1 suppression , by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34 , we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX .
11861791	5	802	PARP - 1 + / + and PARP - 1 - / - mice received a single injection of DOX ( 25 mg / kg i . p ) .
11861791	6	882	Five days after DOX administration , left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP - 1 + / + mice , but only to a smaller extent in PARP - 1 - / - ones .
11861791	7	1042	Similar experiments were conducted in BALB / c mice treated with PJ34 or vehicle .
11861791	8	1122	Treatment with a PJ34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals .
11861791	9	1230	In addition PJ34 significantly reduced the DOX - induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart .
11861791	10	1411	Thus , PARP activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of DOX .
11861791	11	1475	PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe cardiac complications associated with the DOX treatment .
11868798	0	0	Spironolactone : is it a novel drug for the prevention of amphotericin B - related hypokalemia in cancer patients ?
11868798	1	112	OBJECTIVE : Nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin B ( AmB ) , often limiting administration of full dosage .
11868798	2	237	Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB .
11868798	3	401	Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of AmB .
11868798	4	467	This study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment .
11868798	5	633	METHODS : In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection .
11868798	6	867	RESULTS : Patients receiving concomitant AmB and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving AmB alone ( P = 0 . 0027 ) .
11868798	7	1024	Those patients receiving AmB and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range ( P = 0 . 022 ) .
11868798	8	1198	Moreover , urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and spironolactone than those receiving AmB alone ( P = 0 . 040 ) .
11868798	9	1346	CONCLUSION : This study showed that spironolactone can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment .
11890511	0	0	Erectile dysfunction occurs following substantia nigra lesions in the rat .
11890511	1	75	Erectile function was assessed 6 weeks following uni - and bilateral injections of 6 - hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra nucleus of the brain .
11890511	2	221	Behavioral apomorphine - induced penile erections were reduced ( 5 / 8 ) and increased ( 3 / 8 ) in uni - and bilateral lesioned animals .
11890511	3	348	Intracavernous pressures , following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve , decreased in lesioned animals .
11890511	4	462	Lesions of the substantia nigra were confirmed by histology .
11890511	5	523	Concentration of dopamine and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats .
11890511	6	635	Lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with erectile dysfunction in rats and may serve as a model to study erectile dysfunction in Parkinson ' s disease .
11900788	0	0	Nicotine potentiation of morphine - induced catalepsy in mice .
11900788	1	61	In the present study , effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated .
11900788	2	168	Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose - dependent catalepsy .
11900788	3	230	The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine .
11900788	4	284	Intraperitoneal administration of atropine , naloxone , mecamylamine , and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine .
11900788	5	448	Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine , hexamethonium , and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine .
11900788	6	583	Intraperitoneal administration of atropine , but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium , decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine .
11900788	7	757	It was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors , and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms .
11912119	0	0	Force overflow and levodopa - induced dyskinesias in Parkinson ' s disease .
11912119	1	72	We assessed force coordination of the hand in Parkinson ' s disease and its relationship to motor complications of levodopa therapy , particularly to levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LID ) .
11912119	2	255	We studied two groups of Parkinson ' s disease patients with ( Parkinson ' s disease + LID , n = 23 ) and without levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( Parkinson ' s disease - LID , n = 10 ) , and age - matched healthy controls .
11912119	3	462	The motor score of the Unified Parkinson ' s Disease Rating Scale , a dyskinesia score and force in a grip - lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF levodopa .
11912119	4	615	A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON - state in Parkinson ' s disease + LID only .
11912119	5	705	In Parkinson ' s disease + LID , the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa ( by 61 % , P < 0 . 05 ) .
11912119	6	857	An overshooting of peak grip force by 51 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) and of static grip force by 45 % ( P < 0 . 01 ) was observed in the ON - compared with the OFF - drug condition .
11912119	7	1015	In contrast , no excessive force was found in Parkinson ' s disease - LID .
11912119	8	1087	Peak grip force in ON - state was 140 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) higher in Parkinson ' s disease + LID than in Parkinson ' s disease - LID , while static grip force was increased by 138 % ( P < 0 . 01 ) between groups .
11912119	9	1279	Severity of peak - dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in ON - state ( r = 0 . 79 with peak force , P < 0 . 01 ) .
11912119	10	1403	No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication .
11912119	11	1525	Force excess was only observed in patients with LID and motor fluctuations .
11912119	12	1601	A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and dyskinesias in the ON - drug condition .
11912119	13	1708	We postulate that both LID and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations .
11999899	0	0	Behavioral effects of MK - 801 on reserpine - treated mice .
11999899	1	56	The effects of dizocilpine ( MK - 801 ) , a noncompetitive N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , were studied on dopamine - related behaviors induced by reserpine treatments .
11999899	2	235	This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson ' s disease , or tardive dyskinesia , and its response after glutamatergic blockage .
11999899	3	397	Reserpine ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered once every other day for 4 days , produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia , tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice , which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia .
11999899	4	605	Reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy , which are signs suggestive of Parkinson ' s disease .
11999899	5	702	MK - 801 ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) , administered 30 min before the observation test , prevented the vacuous chewing movements , tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by reserpine .
11999899	6	867	However , MK - 801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine - treated mice .
11999899	7	962	Reserpine ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) 5 min before the test , did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice .
11999899	8	1132	On the other hand , reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice .
11999899	9	1229	MK - 801 ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine .
11999899	10	1321	Pretreatment with reserpine ( 1 mg / kg ) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion , as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy , whereas MK - 801 ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine .
11999899	11	1604	These results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal movements , which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian - like and tardive dsykinesia signs .
11999899	12	1802	The glutamatergic blockage produced by NMDA can restore these signs , such as vacuous chewing movements , tongue protrusions , catalepsy and tremor according to the employed model .
12013711	0	0	Risperidone - associated , benign transient visual disturbances in schizophrenic patients with a past history of LSD abuse .
12013711	1	121	Two schizophrenic patients , who had a prior history of LSD abuse and who had previously developed EPS with classic antipsychotics , were successfully treated with risperidone .
12013711	2	296	They both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances , which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone .
12013711	3	434	This imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as " flashbacks " related to prior LSD consumption .
12013711	4	550	Risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off .
12013711	5	639	During a six - month follow - up period , there was no recurrence of visual disturbances .
12013711	6	724	This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign , short - term and self - limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of risperidone or interfere with treatment .
12013711	7	895	Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution .
12042105	0	0	Topiramate - induced nephrolithiasis .
12042105	1	36	Topiramate is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating refractory seizures .
12042105	2	193	Urologists should be aware that this medication can cause metabolic acidosis in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase .
12042105	3	329	In addition , a distal tubular acidification defect may result , thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH . These factors can lead to the development of calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis .
12042105	4	529	We report the first two cases of topiramate - induced nephrolithiasis in the urologic literature .
12091028	0	0	Ketamine in war / tropical surgery ( a final tribute to the racemic mixture ) .
12091028	1	75	A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients , aged from 6 weeks to 70 years , undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates .
12091028	2	389	Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air / oxygen only .
12091028	3	583	After premedication with diazepam , glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia , and induction with standard doses of ketamine , a maintenance dose of 10 - 20 microg / kg / min of ketamine proved safe and effective .
12091028	4	784	Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring , relying heavily on the heart rate .
12091028	5	871	Diazepam , unless contraindicated or risky , remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations .
12091028	6	1102	Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia .
12091028	7	1198	An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h , glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects , especially in a hot climate .
12091028	8	1391	Experience in war / tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life - saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where , e . g . amputation and rapid extrication were required .
12093990	0	0	Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children .
12093990	1	93	BACKGROUND : Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host .
12093990	2	196	The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children , where case fatality rates as high as 50 % to 80 % have been reported .
12093990	3	402	There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease , nor are there any prospective randomized , controlled trials of potentially useful anti - adenovirus therapies .
12093990	4	619	Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series .
12093990	5	742	Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir .
12093990	6	807	Ribavirin , a guanosine analogue , has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses , including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro .
12093990	7	962	Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection , and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C . Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses .
12093990	8	1219	The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia .
12093990	9	1302	The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects , the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity .
12093990	10	1440	OBJECTIVE : We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature .
12093990	11	1610	DESIGN / METHODS : We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease .
12093990	12	1765	Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants , respectively .
12093990	13	1877	The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease .
12093990	14	1986	An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia ; 2 were neonates , 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome .
12093990	15	2101	The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant .
12093990	16	2167	Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate - use protocol .
12093990	17	2239	RESULTS : Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children : the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia .
12093990	18	2466	The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease .
12093990	19	2519	Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated .
12093990	20	2569	Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia .
12093990	21	2660	DISCUSSION : Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease , namely solid - organ and bone marrow transplant recipients , neonates , and children with immunodeficiency .
12093990	22	2911	Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature , therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection .
12093990	23	3128	Early identification , eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response .
12093990	24	3329	CONCLUSIONS : Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered .
12093990	25	3437	The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques , such as polymerase chain reaction , may make earlier , more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible .
12093990	26	3604	Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts , especially children , a large , multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti - adenoviral therapies , such as intravenous ribavirin , is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy .
12101159	0	0	Delayed asystolic cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose ; resuscitation with high dose intravenous calcium .
12101159	1	109	A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1 . 8 - 3 . 6 g of diltiazem , paracetamol , aspirin , isosorbide nitrate , and alcohol .
12101159	2	238	He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids .
12101159	3	375	Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic - clonic seizures .
12101159	4	455	The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia , unrecordable blood pressure , and then became asystolic .
12101159	5	574	He was resuscitated with high dose ( 13 . 5 g ) intravenous calcium and adrenaline ( epinephrine ) .
12101159	6	668	He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours .
12101159	7	743	This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose , particularly with the onset of asystole .
12101159	8	902	It should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose .
12101159	9	985	The case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered .
12109865	0	0	Low - molecular - weight heparin for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves .
12109865	1	89	BACKGROUND : The interruption of oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves , mainly before noncardiac surgery , non - surgical interventions , and pregnancy .
12109865	2	303	Unfractionated heparin ( UH ) is currently the substitute for selected patients .
12109865	3	382	Low - molecular - weight heparin ( LMWH ) offers theoretical advantages over UH , but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to UH in patients with prosthetic valves .
12109865	4	572	HYPOTHESIS : The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice .
12109865	5	754	METHODS : For this paper , the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed .
12109865	6	885	RESULTS : There were eight series and six case reports .
12109865	7	940	None of the studies was randomized , and only one was prospective .
12109865	8	1006	Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete .
12109865	9	1065	After excluding case reports , the following groups were constructed : ( a ) short - term administration , after valve insertion ( n = 212 ) ; ( b ) short - term , perioperative ( noncardiac ) / periprocedural ( n = 114 ) ; ( c ) long - term , due to intolerance to OAC ( n = 16 ) ; ( d ) long - term , in pregnancy ( n = 10 ) .
12109865	10	1356	The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0 . 9 % for all the studies and 0 . 5 , 0 , 20 , and 0 % in groups a , b , c , and d , respectively ; for hemorrhage , the overall rate was 3 . 4 % ( 3 . 8 , 2 . 6 , 10 , and 0 % for the respective groups ) .
12109865	11	1578	CONCLUSIONS : In patients with mechanical heart valves , short - term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH .
12109865	12	1685	Data on mid - and long - term LMWH administration in these patients are sparse .
12109865	13	1762	Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves .
12139551	0	0	Cardiac arrest after intravenous metoclopramide - a case of five repeated injections of metoclopramide causing five episodes of cardiac arrest .
12139551	1	144	We describe a patient where intravenous injection of metoclopramide was immediately followed by asystole repeatedly .
12139551	2	261	The patient received metoclopramide 10 mg i . v . five times during 48 h .
12139551	3	332	After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation , it is clear that every administration of metoclopramide was immediately ( within s ) followed by asystole .
12139551	4	518	The asystole lasted 15 - 30 s on four occasions , on one occasion it lasted 2 min .
12139551	5	598	The patient received atropine 0 . 5 - 1 mg and chest compressions , before sinus rhythm again took over .
12139551	6	698	We interpret this as episodes of cardiac arrest caused by metoclopramide .
12139551	7	772	The rapid injection via the central venous route and the concomitant tapering of dopamine infusion might have contributed in precipitating the adverse drug reaction .
12180796	0	0	Immunohistochemical study on inducible type of nitric oxide ( iNOS ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) and tumor growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 ) in arteritis induced in rats by fenoldopam and theophylline , vasodilators .
12180796	1	223	Arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators , fenoldopam and theophylline , was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) and tumor growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 ) .
12180796	2	478	Rats were administered fenoldopam for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of theophylline .
12180796	3	628	Irrespective of theophylline administration , iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on day 5 and 8 post - fenoldopam - infusion ( DPI ) ; bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI ; TGF - beta1 antigens were observed in ED - 1 - positive cells on and after 5 DPI .
12180796	4	936	These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen , and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat arteritis models .
12180796	5	1126	On the other hand , TGF - beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models .
12231232	0	0	The striatum as a target for anti - rigor effects of an antagonist of mGluR1 , but not an agonist of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors .
12231232	1	141	The aim of the present study was to find out whether the metabotropic receptor 1 ( mGluR1 ) and group II mGluRs , localized in the striatum , are involved in antiparkinsonian - like effects in rats .
12231232	2	334	Haloperidol ( 1 mg / kg ip ) induced parkinsonian - like muscle rigidity , measured as an increased resistance of a rat ' s hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint . ( RS ) - 1 - aminoindan - 1 , 5 - dicarboxylic acid ( AIDA ; 0 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl ) , a potent and selective mGluR1 antagonist , or ( 2R , 4R ) - 4 - aminopyrrolidine - 2 , 4 - dicarboxylate ( 2R , 4R - APDC ; 7 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl ) , a selective group II agonist , was injected bilaterally into the striatum of haloperidol - treated animals .
12231232	3	821	AIDA in doses of 7 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl diminished the haloperidol - induced muscle rigidity .
12231232	4	915	In contrast , 2R , 4R - APDC injections were ineffective .
12231232	5	968	The present results may suggest that the blockade of striatal mGluR1 , but not the stimulation of group II mGluRs , may ameliorate parkinsonian muscle rigidity .
12448656	0	0	A phase II study of thalidomide in advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma .
12448656	1	77	OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the toxicity and activity of thalidomide in patients with advanced metastatic renal cell cancer and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) 165 , with therapy .
12448656	2	306	PATIENTS AND METHODS : 29 patients were enrolled on a study of thalidomide using an intra - patient dose escalation schedule .
12448656	3	429	Patients began thalidomide at 400 mg / d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg / d by day 54 .
12448656	4	519	Fifty - nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL - 2 and 52 % were performance status 2 or 3 .
12448656	5	626	Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients .
12448656	6	711	RESULTS : 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary metastases ( 4 % ) , one minor response , and 2 patients stable for over 6 months .
12448656	7	926	Somnolence and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg / day dose level .
12448656	8	1045	Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels did not change with therapy .
12448656	9	1105	CONCLUSION : These results are consistent with a low level of activity of thalidomide in renal cell carcinoma .
12448656	10	1215	Administration of doses over 800 mg / day was difficult to achieve in this patient population , however lower doses were practical .
12448656	11	1344	The dose - response relationship , if any , of thalidomide for renal cell carcinoma is unclear .
12452237	0	0	Can lidocaine reduce succinylcholine induced postoperative myalgia ?
12452237	1	68	This study was undertaken to determine the effect of lidocaine pretreatment on reduction of succinylcholine - induced myalgia in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery .
12452237	2	261	One hundred and thirty - five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective , double blind , randomized manner .
12452237	3	386	Group PS , the control group , received normal saline and succinylcholine 1 . 5 mg x kg ( - 1 ) ; Group LS , lidocaine 1 . 5 mg x kg ( - 1 ) and succinylcholine 1 . 5 mg x kg ( - 1 ) ; Group PR , normal saline and rocuronium 0 . 6 mg x kg ( - 1 ) .
12452237	4	604	Morphine 0 . 1 mg x kg ( - 1 ) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor , ECG and pulse oximetry .
12452237	5	759	Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg . kg ( - 1 ) thiopental iv . followed by succinylcholine ( Group PS , LS ) or rocuronium ( Group PR ) for tracheal intubation .
12452237	6	907	Following administration of these agents , the presence , and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered .
12452237	7	1098	The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions .
12452237	8	1182	Twenty - four hours later , any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management .
12452237	9	1378	The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
12452237	10	1564	At 24 h , the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
12452237	11	1657	A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation .
12452237	12	1762	The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups .
12452237	13	1875	In conclusion , where succinylcholine is used , lidocaine is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of postoperative myalgia .
12481039	0	0	Reduced sodium channel density , altered voltage dependence of inactivation , and increased susceptibility to seizures in mice lacking sodium channel beta 2 - subunits .
12481039	1	165	Sodium channel beta - subunits modulate channel gating , assembly , and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems .
12481039	2	287	We generated beta2 ( - / - ) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of sodium channel density , localization , and function in neurons in vivo .
12481039	3	434	Measurements of [ ( 3 ) H ] saxitoxin ( STX ) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane sodium channels in beta2 ( - / - ) neurons .
12481039	4	582	The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons .
12481039	5	773	The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced , and the threshold for action potential generation was increased , indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium channels .
12481039	6	1009	In contrast , the conduction velocity , the number and size of axons in the optic nerve , and the specific localization of Na ( v ) 1 . 6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged . beta2 ( - / - ) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures , as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine - induced seizures , but seemed normal in other neurological tests .
12481039	7	1378	Our observations show that beta2 - subunits play an important role in the regulation of sodium channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability .
12549952	0	0	Acute liver failure with concurrent bupropion and carbimazole therapy .
12549952	1	71	OBJECTIVE : To report a case of fatal liver failure possibly associated with concurrent use of bupropion and carbimazole .
12549952	2	192	CASE SUMMARY : A 41 - year - old Chinese man with a history of hyperthyroidism had been treated with carbimazole and propranolol for the past 5 years .
12549952	3	338	He received a 10 - day course of bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation .
12549952	4	443	He developed acute liver failure with rapid deterioration of renal function .
12549952	5	520	Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific drug - induced acute liver injury .
12549952	6	597	His condition was further complicated by sepsis and coagulopathy .
12549952	7	663	Death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms .
12549952	8	715	The likelihood that bupropion induced hepatotoxicity in our patient was possible , based on the Naranjo probability scale .
12549952	9	837	DISCUSSION : Although there is increasing evidence of hepatotoxicity induced by bupropion , this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute liver failure in a patient receiving bupropion while on concomitant treatment with carbimazole .
12549952	10	1094	CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute liver insult induced by bupropion given concurrently with other hepatotoxic drugs .
1255900	0	0	Pyeloureteral filling defects associated with systemic anticoagulation : a case report .
1255900	1	87	The etiology of pyeloureteritis cystica has long been attributed to chronic infection and inflammation .
1255900	2	191	A case is presented that is unique in that the acute onset and the rapid resolution of pyeloureteral filling defects in this patient were documented by radiography .
1255900	3	356	There is no evidence of antecedent or concurrent infection in this patient .
1255900	4	432	The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of heparin therapy for suspected pelvic thrombophlebitis and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation .
1255900	5	594	The rate of resolution of the radiographic findings may be helpful in distinguishing between true pyeloureteritis cystica and submucosal hemorrhage .
12571256	0	0	Nephrotoxic effects in high - risk patients undergoing angiography .
12571256	1	66	BACKGROUND : The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy .
12571256	2	142	Whether iso - osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low - osmolar contrast medium in high - risk patients is uncertain .
12571256	3	267	METHODS : We conducted a randomized , double - blind , prospective , multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso - osmolar , dimeric , nonionic contrast medium , iodixanol , with those of a low - osmolar , nonionic , monomeric contrast medium , iohexol .
12571256	4	522	The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1 . 5 to 3 . 5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography .
12571256	5	688	The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography .
12571256	6	820	Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more , an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or more , and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 .
12571256	7	1030	RESULTS : The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol .
12571256	8	1133	From day 0 to day 3 , the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0 . 13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0 . 55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group ( P = 0 . 001 ; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol , - 0 . 42 mg per deciliter [ 95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 73 to - 0 . 22 ] ) .
12571256	9	1432	Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group ( 3 percent ) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more , as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group ( 26 percent ) ( P = 0 . 002 ; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group , 0 . 09 [ 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 02 to 0 . 41 ] ) .
12571256	10	1764	No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or more , but 10 patients in the iohexol group ( 15 percent ) did .
12571256	11	1899	The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0 . 07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0 . 24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group ( P = 0 . 003 ; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group , - 0 . 17 mg per deciliter [ 95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 34 to - 0 . 07 ] ) .
12571256	12	2214	CONCLUSIONS : Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high - risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low - osmolar , nonionic contrast medium .
12600698	0	0	Protective effect of edaravone against streptomycin - induced vestibulotoxicity in the guinea pig .
12600698	1	97	This study investigated alleviation of streptomycin - induced vestibulotoxicity by edaravone in guinea pigs .
12600698	2	204	Edaravone , a free radical scavenger , has potent free radical quenching action and is used in clinical practice to treat cerebral infarction .
12600698	3	345	Streptomycin was administered to the inner ear by osmotic pump for 24 h , and edaravone ( n = 8 ) or saline ( n = 6 ) was intraperitoneally injected once a day for 7 days .
12600698	4	508	We observed horizontal vestibulo - ocular reflex as a marker of postoperative vestibular function .
12600698	5	605	Animals injected with saline showed statistically smaller gains than those injected with edaravone .
12600698	6	705	These results suggest that edaravone suppresses streptomycin - induced vestibulotoxicity .
12691807	0	0	Levodopa - induced oromandibular dystonia in progressive supranuclear palsy .
12691807	1	75	Levodopa - induced dyskinesias have been reported in Parkinson ' s disease and multiple system atrophy .
12691807	2	175	Cranial dystonias are rare in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) .
12691807	3	257	In this report we describe an unusual case of reversible levodopa - induced Oromandibular dystonia ( OMD ) in a PSP patient to highlight the importance of recognizing this drug related complication in the management of PSP , and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiology .
12734532	0	0	Case report : Dexatrim ( Phenylpropanolamine ) as a cause of myocardial infarction .
12734532	1	81	Phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) is a sympathetic amine used in over - the - counter cold remedies and weight - control preparations worldwide .
12734532	2	212	Its use has been associated with hypertensive episodes and hemorrhagic strokes in younger women .
12734532	3	309	Several reports have linked the abuse of PPA with myocardial injury , especially when overdose is involved .
12734532	4	416	We report here the first case of Dexatrim ( PPA ) - induced myocardial injury in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight control .
12734532	5	565	In addition , we review the 7 other cases of PPA related myocardial injury that have been reported so far .
12734532	6	671	Physicians and patients should be alert to the potential cardiac risk associated with the use of PPA , even at doses generally considered to be safe .
12739036	0	0	Differential diagnosis of high serum creatine kinase levels in systemic lupus erythematosus .
12739036	1	93	We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57 - year - old woman with severe chloroquine - induced myopathy .
12739036	2	203	Since 1989 , she had been suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) with renal involvement and undergone periods of treatment with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide .
12739036	3	376	Additional therapy with chloroquine ( CQ ) was started because of arthralgia .
12739036	4	452	At the same time , slightly increased creatine kinase ( CK ) levels were noted .
12739036	5	529	Myositis was suspected , and the patient was treated with steroids .
12739036	6	596	The CK increase persisted , however , and she developed progressive muscular weakness and muscular atrophy .
12739036	7	702	Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1 , 700 U / l .
12739036	8	770	The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of myositis .
12739036	9	851	Thus , muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude polymyositis or toxic myopathy .
12739036	10	959	As it revealed chloroquine - induced myopathy , medication was stopped .
12739036	11	1028	Discriminating between primary SLE - induced affection of the musculoskeletal system and drug - induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of SLE patients .
12745515	0	0	Seizure associated with sleep deprivation and sustained - release bupropion .
12745515	1	75	This case report describes a generalized seizure associated with sustained - release bupropion use and sleep deprivation .
12745515	2	195	The subject , a 31 - year - old female smoker , was participating in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational medication for smoking cessation that used sustained - release bupropion as an active control .
12745515	3	398	After 5 weeks of bupropion use , the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence .
12745515	4	562	The patient had no other risk factors for seizures .
12745515	5	614	We suggest that sleep deprivation may add to the risk of bupropion - associated seizures .
12760988	0	0	Postoperative myalgia after succinylcholine : no evidence for an inflammatory origin .
12760988	1	85	A common side effect associated with succinylcholine is postoperative myalgia .
12760988	2	164	The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear ; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence .
12760988	3	280	We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia .
12760988	4	387	The incidence and severity of succinylcholine - associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine ( n = 32 for each ) .
12760988	5	564	Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups : 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group , and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients , respectively ( not significant ) .
12760988	6	860	At 48 h after surgery , 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia ( not significant ) .
12760988	7	957	In addition , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline .
12760988	8	1092	We found an increase of IL - 6 for only three patients , but only one patient reported myalgia ; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL - 6 was found .
12760988	9	1253	In conclusion , there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine - associated myalgia .
12760988	10	1355	IMPLICATIONS : Administration of dexamethasone before succinylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succinylcholine - induced postoperative myalgia .
12760988	11	1536	Furthermore , there was no significant relationship between postoperative myalgia and time course of interleukin - 6 concentrations , a marker of inflammation .
12760988	12	1692	Pretreatment with dexamethasone is not justified to prevent postoperative myalgia after succinylcholine .
12842176	0	0	Effect of lindane on hepatic and brain cytochrome P450s and influence of P450 modulation in lindane induced neurotoxicity .
12842176	1	123	Oral administration of lindane ( 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 and 15 mg / kg , body weight ) for 5 days was found to produce a dose - dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7 - ethoxyresorufin - O - deethylase ( EROD ) , 7 - pentoxyresorufin - O - dealkylase ( PROD ) and N - nitrosodimethylamine demethylase ( NDMA - d ) in rat brain and liver .
12842176	2	435	A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) of lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days .
12842176	3	630	As observed with different doses , the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain .
12842176	4	804	Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1 / 1A2 , 2B1 / 2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes .
12842176	5	974	In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD , EROD and NDMA - d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1 / 2B2 , 1A1 / 1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes , respectively .
12842176	6	1274	Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3 - methylcholanthrene ( MC ) , an inducer of P4501A1 / 1A2 , did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of lindane induced convulsions , pretreatment with phenobarbital ( PB ) , an inducer of P450 2B1 / 2B2 or ethanol , an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions , significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions .
12842176	7	1671	Similarly , when the P450 - mediated metabolism of lindane was blocked by cobalt chloride incidence of convulsions was increased in animals treated with lindane indicating that lindane per se or its metabolites formed by PB or ethanol inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral toxicity .
12851669	0	0	Absolute and attributable risk of venous thromboembolism in women on combined cyproterone acetate and ethinylestradiol .
12851669	1	120	OBJECTIVE : To achieve absolute risk estimates of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) among women on cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol ( CPA / EE ) , and among women on combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) .
12851669	2	321	METHODS : From the Danish National Register of Patients ( NRP ) , 1996 to 1998 , the records of 1 . 1 million Danish women , ages 15 to 44 years , were searched for evidence of VTE .
12851669	3	494	COC use was ascertained through mailed questionnaires .
12851669	4	549	Sales statistics of COCs and CPA / EE were provided through Danish Drug Statistics .
12851669	5	631	RESULTS : During the time frame of the study , 330 women were found to have had VTE while on COCs .
12851669	6	728	Of these women , 67 were on levonorgestrel - containing COCs .
12851669	7	787	Eleven were on CPA / EE .
12851669	8	810	The corresponding absolute risk of VTE was 3 . 4 ( range , 3 . 1 - 3 . 8 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on COCs , 4 . 2 ( range , 3 . 2 - 5 . 2 ) per 10 000 women years among women on levonorgestrel - containing COCs , and 3 . 1 ( range , 1 . 3 - 4 . 9 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on CPA / EE .
12851669	9	1088	CONCLUSION : Our results suggest the absolute risk of VTE among Danish women on COCs is similar to that among women taking CPA / EE .
12852481	0	0	Comparison of developmental toxicology of aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) in rats using selected dosing paradigms .
12852481	1	114	BACKGROUND : Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis .
12852481	2	327	Aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA ] ) , an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor , induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day ( GD ) 9 , 10 , or 11 ( Kimmel CA , Wilson JG , Schumacher HJ .
12852481	3	555	Teratology 4 : 15 - 24 , 1971 ) .
12852481	4	582	There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17 .
12852481	5	668	Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9 , 10 , or 11 ; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats ; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used .
12852481	6	1096	METHODS : ASA was administered as a single dose on GD 9 ( 0 , 250 , 500 , or 625 mg / kg ) , 10 ( 0 , 500 , 625 , or 750 mg / kg ) , or 11 ( 0 , 500 , 750 , or 1000 mg / kg ) and from GD 6 to GD 17 ( 0 , 50 , 125 , or 250 mg / kg a day ) in the multiple dose study to SD rats .
12852481	7	1342	Animals were killed on GD 21 , and fetuses were examined viscerally .
12852481	8	1410	RESULTS : The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects ( VSDs ) and midline defects ( MDs ) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia ( DH ) , MDs , and VSDs in rabbits ( Cook JC et al . , 2003 ) ; hence , the present study focused on these malformations , even though ASA induces several other low - incidence malformations .
12852481	9	1746	In single dose studies , DH , MD , and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10 .
12852481	10	1816	VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11 .
12852481	11	1865	In contrast , DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group , and VSD was noted across all dose groups .
12852481	12	2004	CONCLUSIONS : High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats .
12852481	13	2184	Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis ( GDs 6 to 17 ) .
12852481	14	2322	It was also evident that , by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose , malformations that normally occur at low incidence , as reported from previous single dose studies , could also be induced with ASA given at multiple doses .
1286498	0	0	Reversal of central benzodiazepine effects by flumazenil after intravenous conscious sedation with diazepam and opioids : report of a double - blind multicenter study .
1286498	1	165	The Flumazenil in Intravenous Conscious Sedation with Diazepam Multicenter Study Group II .
1286498	2	256	The efficacy and safety of a new benzodiazepine antagonist , flumazenil , were assessed in a double - blind multicenter study .
1286498	3	379	Flumazenil ( mean dose , 0 . 76 mg ) or placebo ( mean dose , 8 . 9 ml ) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients , respectively , who had been given diazepam in conjunction with an opioid ( fentanyl , meperidine , or morphine ) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures .
1286498	4	724	The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with flumazenil and 64 patients given placebo .
1286498	5	836	After 5 minutes , 80 / 115 ( 70 % ) flumazenil - treated patients , compared with 21 / 63 ( 33 % ) placebo - treated patients , were completely awake and alert , as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer ' s Assessment of Alertness / Sedation Scale .
1286498	6	1067	Ninety - five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5 - minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180 - minute assessment period .
1286498	7	1239	Flumazenil - treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger - to - Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5 - minute assessment .
1286498	8	1391	Flumazenil was well tolerated , with no serious adverse effects reported .
1286498	9	1464	Thirty - nine ( 30 % ) of flumazenil - treated patients , compared with 17 ( 25 % ) of placebo - treated patients had one or more drug - related adverse experiences .
1286498	10	1615	The most common adverse effects were nausea and vomiting in the flumazenil group and nausea and injection - site pain in the placebo group .
1286498	11	1753	Flumazenil was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by diazepam in the presence of opioids .
12907924	0	0	Methylphenidate - induced obsessive - compulsive symptoms in an elderly man .
12907924	1	73	An 82 - year - old man with treatment - resistant depression and early Alzheimer ' s disease was started on methylphenidate .
12907924	2	190	Significant obsessive - compulsive behavior ensued but diminished over several weeks when methylphenidate was replaced by fluvoxamine .
12907924	3	323	The patient had no prior psychiatric history , but he had a sister with obsessive - compulsive disorder .
12907924	4	425	It appears that methylphenidate precipitated the patient ' s pathological behavior .
12911170	0	0	Ciprofloxacin - induced acute interstitial nephritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia .
12911170	1	84	Ciprofloxacin has been associated with several side effects including interstitial nephritis and hemolytic anemia .
12911170	2	199	The combination of both side effects is extremely rare .
12911170	3	255	In this report , we describe a case of ciprofloxacin - induced interstitial nephritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia .
12911170	4	371	Hemolytic anemia improved after stopping the drug and initiation of steroid therapy .
12911170	5	456	Unfortunately , acute interstitial nephritis was irreversible and the patient developed end - stage renal disease .
1300436	0	0	Potential deleterious effect of furosemide in radiocontrast nephropathy .
1300436	1	73	The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy . 18 patients , referred to a radiocontrast study , considered at risk because of preexisting renal insufficiency , were enrolled in a prospective , randomized , controlled trial , performed at the secondary care center of a 1 , 100 - bed private university hospital .
1300436	2	480	In addition to fluids , the treatment group received furosemide ( mean dose 110 mg ) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material .
1300436	3	628	The control group received fluids ( mean 3 liters ) .
1300436	4	679	Radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non - ionic contrast material , at an average dose of 245 ml .
1300436	5	815	Renal function significantly deteriorated in the group pretreated with furosemide ( p < 0 . 005 by ANOVA ) , with a rise in serum creatinine from 145 + / - 13 to 182 + / - 16 mumol / l at 24 h , while no change occurred in the control group ( from 141 + / - 6 to 142 + / - 7 mumol / l ) .
1300436	6	1083	Renal failure was associated with weight loss in the furosemide - treated group .
1300436	7	1162	Furosemide may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy .

133615	2	50	Thromboembolic and other complications of oral contraceptive therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of blood coagulation factors : summary report of a ten - year study .
133615	3	224	During a ten - year period , 348 women were studied for a total of 5 , 877 patient months in four separate studies relating oral contraceptives to changes in hematologic parameters .
133615	4	401	Significant increases in certain factors of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysin systems ( factors I , II , VII , VIII , IX , and X and plasminogen ) were observed in the treated groups .
133615	5	579	Severe complications developed in four patients .
133615	6	628	All four had an abnormal blood coagulation profile , suggesting " hypercoagulability " before initiation of therapy .
133615	7	742	Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients ; some increased further during therapy .
133615	8	885	One of these patients developed a myocardial infarction before receiving any medication , shortly after the base - line values were obtained .
133615	9	1024	One patient developed retinopathy 19 months after she began therapy , and another developed thrombophlebitis after 27 months of therapy .
133615	10	1160	The fourth patient developed thrombophlebitis 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy .
133615	11	1257	All four patients were of the A or AB blood group .
133615	12	1308	Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for thromboembolic episodes in patients possessing the A antigen .
133615	13	1442	It appears from these data that hematologic work - ups may be useful in women who are about to start long - term oral contraceptive therapy .
1355091	0	0	Orthostatic hypotension occurs following alpha 2 - adrenoceptor blockade in chronic prazosin - pretreated conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats . 1 .
1355091	1	148	Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2 - adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) . 2 .
1355091	2	365	Conscious SHR ( male 300 - 350 g ) were subjected to 90 degrees head - up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of prazosin ( 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) or rauwolscine ( 3 mg kg - 1 i . v . ) .
1355091	3	543	Orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease ( % ) in mean arterial pressure ( MAP femoral ) over the 60 - s tilt period .
1355091	4	677	The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin ( - 23 % ( - ) - 26 % MAP ) and rauwolscine ( - 16 % ( - ) - 33 % MAP ) .
1355091	5	805	However , the head - up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin ( - 16 % MAP , n = 6 ) , but not in the SHR treated with rauwolscine ( less than + 2 % MAP , n = 6 ) . 3 .
1355091	6	990	Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with prazosin at 2 mg kg - 1 day - 1 i . p . for chronic alpha 1 - adrenoceptor blockade .
1355091	7	1109	MAP in conscious SHR after chronic prazosin treatment was 14 % lower than in the untreated SHR ( n = 8 ) .
1355091	8	1212	Head - up tilts in these rats did not produce orthostatic hypotension when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of prazosin ( 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) .
1355091	9	1365	Conversely , administration of rauwolscine ( 3 mg kg - 1 i . v . ) in chronic prazosin treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12 - 31 % ( n = 4 ) , and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19 - 23 % in these rats . 4 .
1355091	10	1577	The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1 - agonist cirazoline ( 0 . 6 and 2 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . ) , the alpha 2 - agonist Abbott - 53693 ( 1 and 3 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . ) , and noradrenaline ( 0 . 1 and 1 . 0 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . ) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic prazosin pretreatment .
1355091	11	1882	Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic prazosin treated SHR ( n = 4 ) as compared to the untreated SHR ( n = 4 ) .
1355091	12	2034	On the other hand , the pressor effects of Abbott - 53693 were similar in both groups of SHR , but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic prazosin treatment than without such treatment .
1355091	13	2238	Furthermore , the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline - induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic prazosin treatment despite a 47 - 71 % reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1 - receptor blocked SHR .

1415380	0	0	Hemolytic - uremic syndrome associated with ingestion of quinine .
1415380	1	64	Hemolytic - uremic syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon , with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature .
1415380	2	217	We describe a 5th case .
1415380	3	241	The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of quinine .
1415380	4	355	Treatment has included use of plasma exchange , prednisone , aspirin , and dipyridamole .
1415380	5	441	The patients have all regained some degree of renal function .
1415380	6	503	However , it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement .
1415380	7	622	Quinine - associated hemolytic - uremic syndrome probably occurs more often than is recognized .
1415380	8	714	It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further quinine exposure , since the reaction seems to be recurrent .
1423339	0	0	Amnestic syndrome associated with propranolol toxicity : a case report .
1423339	1	71	An elderly woman developed an Alzheimer - like subacute dementia as a result of propranolol toxicity .
1423339	2	171	Analysis of the manifestations showed that severe impairment of memory accounted for virtually all of the abnormalities .
1423339	3	292	There is evidence that cerebral reactions to drug toxicity can exhibit patterns that suggest highly selective involvement of functional subdivisions of the brain .
1445986	0	0	Cefotetan - induced immune hemolytic anemia .
1445986	1	43	Immune hemolytic anemia due to a drug - adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving penicillins and first - generation cephalosporins .
1445986	2	202	We describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous cefotetan .
1445986	3	284	Cefotetan - dependent antibodies were detected in the patient ' s serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells .
1445986	4	404	The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of cefotetan , suggesting the concomitant formation of warm - reactive autoantibodies .
1445986	5	555	These observations , in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular hemolysis , are consistent with drug - induced hemolytic anemia , possibly involving both drug - adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms .
1445986	6	786	This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all cephalosporins .
14633084	0	0	Use of dexamethasone with mesna for the prevention of ifosfamide - induced hemorrhagic cystitis .
14633084	1	95	AIM : Hemorrhagic cystitis ( HC ) is a limiting side - effect of chemotherapy with ifosfamide ( IFS ) .
14633084	2	191	In the study presented here , we investigated the use of dexamethasone in combination with mesna for the prevention of IFS - induced HC .
14633084	3	325	METHODS : Male Wistar rats ( 150 - 200 g ; 6 rats per group ) were treated with saline or mesna 5 min ( i . p . ) before and 2 and 6 h after ( v . o . ) administration of IFS .
14633084	4	485	One , two or three doses of mesna were replaced with dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone plus mesna .
14633084	5	591	Cystitis was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis .
14633084	6	721	RESULTS : The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by IFS by 84 . 79 % and 89 . 13 % , respectively .
14633084	7	907	In addition , it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by IFS .
14633084	8	1000	Moreover , the addition of dexamethasone to the last two doses of mesna was more efficient than three doses of mesna alone when evaluated microscopically .
14633084	9	1154	CONCLUSION : Dexamethasone in combination with mesna was efficient in blocking IFS - induced HC .
14633084	10	1248	However , the replacement of last two doses of mesna with saline or all of the mesna doses with dexamethasone did not prevent HC .
14648024	0	0	All - trans - retinoic acid - induced erythema nodosum in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia .
14648024	1	97	Erythema nodosum associated with all - trans - retinoic acid ( ATRA ) for acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is very rare .
14648024	2	215	We describe four patients with classic APL who developed erythema nodosum during ATRA therapy .
14648024	3	310	Fever and subsequent multiple painful erythematous nodules over extremities developed on D11 , D16 , D17 , and D19 , respectively , after ATRA therapy .
14648024	4	457	The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with erythema nodosum .
14648024	5	535	All patients received short course of steroids .
14648024	6	583	Fever subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely .
14648024	7	649	All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of ATRA .
14648024	8	718	ATRA seemed to be the most possible etiology of erythema nodosum in our patients .
14648024	9	800	Short - term use of steroid is very effective in ATRA - induced erythema nodosum .
14704468	0	0	Effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with valproate or clonazepam in amygdala - kindled rats .
14704468	1	145	Loreclezole ( 5 mg / kg ) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala - kindled rats , reducing both seizure and afterdischarge durations .
14704468	2	285	The combinations of loreclezole ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) with valproate , clonazepam , or carbamazepine ( applied at their subprotective doses ) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test .
14704468	3	461	However , only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature .
14704468	4	540	Among several chemoconvulsants , bicuculline , N - methyl - D - aspartic acid and BAY k - 8644 ( the opener of L - type calcium channels ) reversed the protective activity of loreclezole alone and its combination with valproate .
14704468	5	755	On the other hand , bicuculline , aminophylline and BAY k - 8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of loreclezole combined with clonazepam .
14704468	6	893	The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L - type of calcium channels .
14736955	0	0	Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in doxorubicin nephrosis .
14736955	1	93	BACKGROUND : Doxorubicin induces a self - perpetuating nephropathy characterized by early glomerular and late - onset tubular lesions in rats .
14736955	2	231	We investigated the potential role of mitochondrial injury in the onset of these lesions .
14736955	3	321	METHODS : Rats were treated with intravenous doxorubicin ( 1 mg kg ( - 1 ) week ( - 1 ) ) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ( ' short - term ' ) or 30 weeks ( ' long - term ' ) following the last dose .
14736955	4	512	Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia .
14736955	5	593	All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age .
14736955	6	634	Glomerular and tubular injury was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components .
14736955	7	756	Finally , we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) as well as superoxide production and the 4834 base pair ' common ' mtDNA deletion .
14736955	8	903	RESULTS : The ' long - term ' group had significant glomerular and tubular lesions , depressed activities of mtDNA - encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome - c oxidase ( COX ) and increased citrate synthase activity .
14736955	9	1111	In addition , expression of the mtDNA - encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased .
14736955	10	1215	In ' short - term ' rats , there were fewer tubular lesions , but similar numbers of glomerular lesions activity .
14736955	11	1323	Among all animals , glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels , mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain subunit COX - I .
14736955	12	1538	Injury was positively correlated with superoxide production and the activities of nucleus - encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes .
14736955	13	1674	Kidneys from the ' long - term ' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in ' short - term ' animals and these were not observed in the other groups .
14736955	14	1815	CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain function and induction of superoxide in doxorubicin - induced renal lesions .
14742097	0	0	A randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover study of ephedrine for SSRI - induced female sexual dysfunction .
14742097	1	107	The objective of this study was to determine whether ephedrine , an alpha - and beta - adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women , has beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant - induced sexual dysfunction .
14742097	2	345	Nineteen sexually dysfunctional women receiving either fluoxetine , sertraline , or paroxetine participated in an eight - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study of the effects of ephedrine ( 50 mg ) on self - report measures of sexual desire , arousal , orgasm , and sexual satisfaction .
14742097	3	640	Although there were significant improvements relative to baseline in sexual desire and orgasm intensity / pleasure on 50 mg ephedrine 1 - hr prior to sexual activity , significant improvements in these measures , as well as in sexual arousal and orgasmic ability also were noted with placebo .
14742097	4	927	These findings highlight the importance of conducting placebo - controlled trials for this condition .
14745746	0	0	Does hormone therapy for the treatment of breast cancer have a detrimental effect on memory and cognition ?
14745746	1	107	A pilot study .
14745746	2	122	This pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for breast cancer affects cognition .
14745746	3	209	Patients participating in a randomised trial of anastrozole , tamoxifen alone or combined ( ATAC ) ( n = 94 ) and a group of women without breast cancer ( n = 35 ) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures .
14745746	4	414	Compared with the control group , the patients were impaired on a processing speed task ( p = 0 . 032 ) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory ( p = 0 . 026 ) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups .
14745746	5	642	Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity .
14745746	6	761	The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer .
14745746	7	911	Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in oestrogen levels , a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women .
14745746	8	1073	In view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly .
14975762	0	0	Expression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in vivo .
14975762	1	69	Doxorubicin is an anti - tumor agent that represses cardiac - specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis .
14975762	2	191	Doxorubicin depletes cardiac p300 , a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes .
14975762	3	346	However , the role of p300 in protection against doxorubicin - induced apoptosis is unknown .
14975762	4	436	Transgenic mice overexpressing p300 in the heart and wild - type mice were subjected to doxorubicin treatment .
14975762	5	545	Compared with wild - type mice , transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha - sarcomeric actin .
14975762	6	724	Doxorubicin induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild - type mice but not in transgenic mice .
14975762	7	816	Expression of p300 increased the cardiac level of bcl - 2 and mdm - 2 , but not that of p53 or other members of the bcl - 2 family .
14975762	8	941	These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from doxorubicin - induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo .
14982270	0	0	Methimazole - induced cholestatic jaundice .
14982270	1	42	Methimazole is a widely used and generally well - tolerated antithyroid agent .
14982270	2	119	A 43 - year - old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole ( 10 mg tid ) and propranolol ( 20 mg tid ) for treatment of hyperthyroidism .
14982270	3	281	The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medications .
14982270	4	402	When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later , she still had severe icterus , pruritus , and hyperbilirubinemia , formed mainly of the conjugated fraction .
14982270	5	561	Methimazole - induced cholestasis was diagnosed , and propranolol therapy was resumed .
14982270	6	645	Over the following 9 days , the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without methimazole .
14982270	7	770	In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy , this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaundice .
14982270	8	887	Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that , upon occurrence , they can discontinue methimazole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures .
15042318	0	0	Atrial fibrillation following chemotherapy for stage IIIE diffuse large B - cell gastric lymphoma in a patient with myotonic dystrophy ( Steinert ' s disease ) .
15042318	1	155	The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B - cell gastric lymphoma and myotonic dystrophy , the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy , and sudden atrial fibrillation following one cycle of doxorubicin - based chemotherapy in the same patient .
15042318	2	420	Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy .
15042318	3	534	The cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient .
1504402	0	0	Hypersensitivity immune reaction as a mechanism for dilevalol - associated hepatitis .
1504402	1	84	OBJECTIVE : To assess lymphocyte reactivity to dilevalol and to serum containing putative ex vivo dilevalol antigens or metabolites in a case of dilevalol - induced liver injury .
1504402	2	260	PATIENT : A 58 - year - old woman with a clinical diagnosis of dilevalol - induced liver injury .
1504402	3	350	METHODS : Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from the patient were cultured in the presence of a solution of dilevalol and also with sera collected from a volunteer before and after dilevalol intake .
1504402	4	559	A similar protocol was performed with lymphocytes from a healthy subject .
1504402	5	633	RESULTS : No lymphocyte proliferation was observed either in the patient or in the healthy volunteer in the presence of dilevalol solutions .
1504402	6	773	A significant proliferative response to serum collected after dilevalol intake was observed in the case of the patient compared with the proliferative response to the serum collected before the drug intake .
1504402	7	980	No reactivity was found when lymphocytes from the healthy subject were tested under similar conditions .
1504402	8	1084	CONCLUSIONS : The methodology used allowed the detection of lymphocyte sensitization to sera containing ex vivo - prepared dilevalol antigens , suggesting the involvement of an immunologic mechanism in dilevalol - induced liver injury .
15075188	0	0	Increased expression and apical targeting of renal ENaC subunits in puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome in rats .
15075188	1	130	Nephrotic syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized edema .
15075188	2	213	However , the molecular basis for the decreased renal sodium excretion remains undefined .
15075188	3	302	We hypothesized that epithelial Na channel ( ENaC ) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium retention .
15075188	4	429	An experimental group of rats was treated with puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ; 180 mg / kg iv ) , whereas the control group received only vehicle .
15075188	5	572	After 7 days , PAN treatment induced significant proteinuria , hypoalbuminemia , decreased urinary sodium excretion , and extensive ascites .
15075188	6	709	The protein abundance of alpha - ENaC and beta - ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla ( ISOM ) and in the inner medulla ( IM ) but was not altered in the cortex . gamma - ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex , ISOM , and IM .
15075188	7	950	Immunoperoxidase brightfield - and laser - scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha - ENaC , beta - ENaC , and gamma - ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT2 ) , connecting tubule , and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments .
15075188	8	1257	Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha - ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of PAN - treated rats , indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha - ENaC subunits .
15075188	9	1492	In contrast , the protein abundances of Na ( + ) / H ( + ) exchanger type 3 ( NHE3 ) , Na ( + ) - K ( + ) - 2Cl ( - ) cotransporter ( BSC - 1 ) , and thiazide - sensitive Na ( + ) - Cl ( - ) cotransporter ( TSC ) were decreased .
15075188	10	1679	Moreover , the abundance of the alpha ( 1 ) - subunit of the Na - K - ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM , but it remained unchanged in the IM .
15075188	11	1821	In conclusion , the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2 , connecting tubule , and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN - induced nephrotic syndrome .
15075188	12	2082	The decreased abundance of NHE3 , BSC - 1 , TSC , and Na - K - ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion .
15096016	0	0	Pallidal stimulation : an alternative to pallidotomy ?
15096016	1	53	A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985 .
15096016	2	209	Laitinen ' s procedure improved most symptoms in drug - resistant PD , which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community .
15096016	3	338	Another lesioning procedure , ventrolateral thalamotomy , has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius , producing high long - term success rates and low morbidity rates .
15096016	4	540	Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success .
15096016	5	596	According to the literature pallidotomy improves the " on " symptoms of PD , such as dyskinesias , as well as the " off " symptoms , such as rigidity , bradykinesia , and on - off fluctuations .
15096016	6	779	Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent ; however , its strength seems to be in improving levodopa - induced dyskinesias .
15096016	7	931	Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper - or dyskinetic upper limbs , but increases the " freezing " phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time .
15096016	8	1091	Considering the small increase in the patient ' s independence , the high costs of bilateral implants , and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices , the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy .
15266215	0	0	Effects of the cyclooxygenase - 2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with arthritis .
15266215	1	182	There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events may be higher with cyclooxygenase ( COX ) - 2 - specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
15266215	2	383	We evaluated cardiovascular event data for valdecoxib , a new COX - 2 - specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials .
15266215	3	600	The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events ( cardiac , cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular , or arterial thrombotic ) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib ( 10 - 80 mg daily ) , nonselective NSAID ( diclofenac 75 mg bid , ibuprofen 800 mg tid , or naproxen 500 mg bid ) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6 - 52 weeks in duration .
15266215	4	994	The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients ( n = 7934 ) and in users of low - dose ( < or = 325 mg daily ) aspirin ( n = 1051 ) and nonusers of aspirin ( n = 6883 ) .
15266215	5	1168	Crude and exposure - adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for valdecoxib , NSAIDs , and placebo .
15266215	6	1278	The risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each valdecoxib dose .
15266215	7	1359	Thrombotic risk was consistently higher for users of aspirin users than nonusers of aspirin ( placebo , 1 . 4 % vs . 0 % ; valdecoxib , 1 . 7 % vs . 0 . 2 % ; NSAIDs , 1 . 9 % vs . 0 . 5 % ) .
15266215	8	1525	The rates of events in users of aspirin were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across valdecoxib doses .
15266215	9	1634	Short - and intermediate - term treatment with therapeutic ( 10 or 20 mg daily ) and supratherapeutic ( 40 or 80 mg daily ) valdecoxib doses was not associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in controlled clinical trials .
15266362	0	0	Hypersensitivity myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart .
15266362	1	77	The present report describes a case of eosinophilic myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .
15266362	2	183	The 47 - year - old female patient , known to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , was admitted with biventricular failure and managed aggressively with dobutamine infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation .
15266362	3	412	On transthoracic echocardiogram , she had moderate left ventricular dysfunction with regional variability and moderate mitral regurgitation .
15266362	4	552	The recipient ' s heart showed the features of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis with abundant eosinophils .
15266362	5	675	Myocarditis is rare and eosinophilic myocarditis is rarer .
15266362	6	734	It is likely that the hypersensitivity ( eosinophilic ) myocarditis was related to dobutamine infusion therapy .
15266362	7	844	Eosinophilic myocarditis has been reported with an incidence of 2 . 4 % to 7 . 2 % in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy .
15276120	0	0	Time trends in warfarin - associated hemorrhage .
15276120	1	47	The annual incidence of warfarin - related bleeding at Brigham and Women ' s Hospital increased from 0 . 97 / 1 , 000 patient admissions in the first time period ( January 1995 to October 1998 ) to 1 . 19 / 1 , 000 patient admissions in the second time period ( November 1998 to August 2002 ) of this study .
15276120	2	335	The proportion of patients with major and intracranial bleeding increased from 20 . 2 % and 1 . 9 % , respectively , in the first time period , to 33 . 3 % and 7 . 8 % , respectively , in the second .
1535072	0	0	Yohimbine treatment of sexual side effects induced by serotonin reuptake blockers .
1535072	1	83	BACKGROUND : Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that yohimbine facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of male impotence .
1535072	2	234	A single case report suggests that yohimbine may be used to treat the sexual side effects of clomipramine .
1535072	3	341	This study evaluated yohimbine as a treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers .
1535072	4	454	METHOD : Six patients with either obsessive compulsive disorder , trichotillomania , anxiety , or affective disorders who suffered sexual side effects after treatment with serotonin reuptake blockers were given yohimbine on a p . r . n . basis in an open clinical trial .
1535072	5	716	Various doses of yohimbine were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient .
1535072	6	799	RESULTS : Five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking yohimbine .
1535072	7	897	One patient who failed to comply with yohimbine treatment had no therapeutic effects .
1535072	8	983	Side effects of yohimbine included excessive sweating , increased anxiety , and a wound - up feeling in some patients .
1535072	9	1098	CONCLUSION : The results of this study indicate that yohimbine may be an effective treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers .
1535072	10	1257	Future controlled studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of yohimbine for this indication .
1545575	0	0	Hemorrhagic cystitis complicating bone marrow transplantation .
1545575	1	63	Hemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious complication of high - dose cyclophosphamide therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation .
1545575	2	209	As standard practice at our institution , patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation .
1545575	3	388	In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation , we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with mesna , which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes hemorrhagic cystitis .
1545575	4	612	Of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis , 4 had symptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis .
1545575	5	702	In contrast , two of four consecutive patients who received mesna uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 weeks .
1545575	6	882	Because of this suboptimal result , we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis .
15517007	0	0	Consensus statement concerning cardiotoxicity occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases , with special reference to systemic sclerosis and multiple sclerosis .
15517007	1	214	Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune diseases .
15517007	2	363	Worldwide , over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials .
15517007	3	465	The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials .
15517007	4	538	However , as predicted , significant transplant - related morbidity and mortality have been observed .
15517007	5	636	This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections .
15517007	6	754	The number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low .
15517007	7	811	However , caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage , for example , systemic sclerosis patients .
15517007	8	1005	In November 2002 , a meeting was held in Florence , bringing together a number of experts in various fields , including rheumatology , cardiology , neurology , pharmacology and transplantation medicine .
15517007	9	1202	The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data , both published or available , in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation autoimmune disease database , and to propose a safe approach to such patients .
15517007	10	1424	A full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation .
15531665	0	0	Does supplemental vitamin C increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes ?
15531665	1	89	BACKGROUND : Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant ; however , it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro .
15531665	2	236	These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis .
15531665	3	360	OBJECTIVE : The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease .
15531665	4	481	DESIGN : We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease ( n = 281 ) , coronary artery disease ( n = 175 ) , and stroke ( n = 57 ) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline .
15531665	5	722	Diet was assessed with a food - frequency questionnaire at baseline , and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y . RESULTS : After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors , type of diabetes medication used , duration of diabetes , and intakes of folate , vitamin E , and beta - carotene , the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1 . 0 , 0 . 97 , 1 . 11 , 1 . 47 , and 1 . 84 ( P for trend < 0 . 01 ) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements .
15531665	6	1256	Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1 . 0 , 0 . 81 , 0 . 99 , 1 . 26 , and 1 . 91 ( P for trend = 0 . 01 ) and of stroke were 1 . 0 , 0 . 52 , 1 . 23 , 2 . 22 , and 2 . 57 ( P for trend < 0 . 01 ) .
15531665	7	1438	When dietary and supplemental vitamin C were analyzed separately , only supplemental vitamin C showed a positive association with mortality endpoints .
15531665	8	1588	Vitamin C intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline .
15531665	9	1701	CONCLUSION : A high vitamin C intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with diabetes .
15565293	0	0	Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy .
15565293	1	107	PURPOSE : To map and identify the pattern , in vivo , of axonal degeneration in ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) .
15565293	2	262	Ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis .
15565293	3	337	A serious complication of ethambutol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , and color vision .
15565293	4	465	However , early on , when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible , the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss .
15565293	5	607	METHODS : Three subjects with a history of ethambutol ( EMB ) - induced optic neuropathy of short - , intermediate - , and long - term visual deficits were administered a full neuro - ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity , color vision , contrast sensitivity , and fundus examination .
15565293	6	890	In addition , OCT ( OCT 3000 , Humphrey - Zeiss , Dublin , CA ) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) analysis protocol .
15565293	7	1051	OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL .
15565293	8	1145	RESULTS : The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT , n = 661 .
15565293	9	1280	In all subjects with history of EMB - induced optic neuropathy , there was a mean loss of 72 % nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant ( patient A , with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields , 58 % loss ; patient B , with intermediate visual deficits , 68 % loss ; patient C , with chronic visual deficits , 90 % loss ) , with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26 + / - 16 microm .
15565293	10	1668	There was a combined mean loss of 46 % of fibers from the superior , inferior , and nasal quadrants in the ( six ) eyes of all three subjects ( mean average thickness of 55 + / - 29 microm ) .
15565293	11	1849	In both sets ( four ) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits ( patients B and C ) , there was an average loss of 79 % of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant .
15565293	12	2029	CONCLUSIONS : The OCT results in these patients with EMB - induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers .
15565293	13	2168	This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo - cellular axons ( or small - caliber axons ) within the papillo - macular bundle in toxic or hereditary optic neuropathies .
15565293	14	2377	OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuropathies .
15565293	15	2456	Additionally , in terms of management of EMB - induced optic neuropathy , it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached .
15579441	0	0	Hypoxia in renal disease with proteinuria and / or glomerular hypertension .
15579441	1	74	Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level , relatively few methods have been available .
15579441	2	213	In this study , we developed a new hypoxia - responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia - responsive element of the 5 ' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia - sensing transgenic rat .
15579441	3	436	We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney .
15579441	4	541	With this model , we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model .
15579441	5	729	Expression of the hypoxia - responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period , reaching 2 . 2 - fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2 . 6 - fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model , whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease , reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes .
15579441	6	1065	The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models .
15579441	7	1176	Finally , we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen - positive , ED - 1 - positive , and terminal dUTP nick - end labeled - positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model .
15579441	8	1387	We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases .
15580403	0	0	Adequate timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C .
15580403	1	146	BACKGROUND : Hemolytic anemia is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin .
15580403	2	266	Because of ribavirin - related hemolytic anemia , dose reduction is a common event in this therapy .
15580403	3	363	In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy .
15580403	4	522	METHODS : Thirty - seven of 160 patients who had HCV - genotype 1b , had high virus load , and received 24 - week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level < 10 g / dl or anemia - related signs during therapy .
15580403	5	735	After that , these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin ( 200 mg ) per day .
15580403	6	820	After reduction of ribavirin , 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks ( group A ) .
15580403	7	938	However , 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their < 8 . 5 g / dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia - related severe side effects occurred ( group B ) .
15580403	8	1145	We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups A and B . RESULTS : A sustained virological response ( SVR ) was 29 . 6 % ( 8 / 27 ) in group A and 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group B , respectively .
15580403	9	1352	A 34 . 4 % ( 12 / 27 ) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group B ( P = 0 . 051 ) , with slight significance .
15580403	10	1486	With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction , a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or = 10 g / dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with < 10 g / dl ( P = 0 . 036 ) .
15580403	11	1692	CONCLUSIONS : Reduction of ribavirin at hemoglobin level > or = 10 g / dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects .
15638391	0	0	Aging process of epithelial cells of the rat prostate lateral lobe in experimental hyperprolactinemia induced by haloperidol .
15638391	1	126	The aim of the study was to examine the influence of hyperprolactinemia , induced by haloperidol ( HAL ) on age related morphology and function changes of epithelial cells in rat prostate lateral lobe .
15638391	2	325	The study was performed on sexually mature male rats .
15638391	3	379	Serum concentrations of prolactin ( PRL ) and testosterone ( T ) were measured .
15638391	4	455	Tissue sections were evaluated with light and electron microscopy .
15638391	5	522	Immunohistochemical reactions for Anti - Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen ( PCNA ) were performed .
15638391	6	619	In rats of the experimental group , the mean concentration of : PRL was more than twice higher , whereas T concentration was almost twice lower than that in the control group .
15638391	7	792	Light microscopy visualized the following : hypertrophy and epithelium hyperplasia of the glandular ducts , associated with increased PCNA expression .
15638391	8	941	Electron microscopy revealed changes in columnar epithelial cells , concerning organelles , engaged in protein synthesis and secretion .
1564236	0	0	Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of coronary stenosis : correlation with thallium - 201 single - photon emission tomography .
1564236	1	184	It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation .
1564236	2	440	The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis .
1564236	3	681	The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual - perfusion technique and with thallium - 201 single - photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) .
1564236	4	894	During a transient ( 20 - s ) coronary occlusion , a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced .
1564236	5	1061	The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 74 ; p less than 0 . 002 ) .
1564236	6	1169	During dipyridamole - induced hyperemia , 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography .
1564236	7	1325	The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild ( 0 % to 50 % ) reduction in dipyridamole - induced hyperemia .
1564236	8	1462	The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 61 ; p = 0 . 02 ) .
1564236	9	1589	Thallium - 201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole - induced hyperemia ; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 58 ; p less than 0 . 03 ) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography ( r = 0 . 58 ; p less than 0 . 03 ) .
1564236	10	1896	Thus , myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis .
1564236	11	2072	The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium - 201 SPECT .
15673851	0	0	The activation of spinal N - methyl - D - aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of spinal cord ischemia .
15673851	1	196	We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of N - methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats .
15673851	2	422	Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter .
15673851	3	510	In a microdialysis study , 10 muL of saline ( group C ; n = 8 ) or 30 mug of morphine ( group M ; n = 8 ) was injected intrathecally ( IT ) 0 . 5 h after reflow , and 30 mug of morphine ( group SM ; n = 8 ) or 10 muL of saline ( group SC ; n = 8 ) was injected IT 0 . 5 h after sham operation .
15673851	4	784	Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia , before IT injection , and at 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , and 48 h of reperfusion ( after IT injection ) .
15673851	5	921	Second , we investigated the effect of IT MK - 801 ( 30 mug ) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine - induced spastic paraparesis .
15673851	6	1072	After IT morphine , the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) glutamate concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
15673851	7	1220	This increase persisted for 8 hrs .
15673851	8	1255	IT MK - 801 significantly reduced the number of dark - stained alpha - motoneurons after morphine - induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group .
15673851	9	1407	These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate , which is involved in NMDA receptor activation .
15673851	10	1565	We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via NMDA receptor activation .
15686794	0	0	Acute low back pain during intravenous administration of amiodarone : a report of two cases .
15686794	1	92	Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent - onset atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and maintenance of sinus rhythm .
15686794	2	239	We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent - onset atrial fibrillation , who experienced an acute devastating low back pain a few minutes after initiation of intravenous amiodarone loading .
15686794	3	438	Notably , this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical literature .
15686794	4	518	Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution .
15764424	0	0	Quantitative drug levels in stimulant psychosis : relationship to symptom severity , catecholamines and hyperkinesia .
15764424	1	116	To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels , catecholamines , and psychotic symptoms , nineteen patients in a psychiatric emergency service with a diagnosis of amphetamine - or cocaine - induced psychosis were interviewed , and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and catecholamine metabolite levels .
15764424	2	476	Methamphetamine or amphetamine levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global hyperkinesia rating .
15764424	3	597	HVA levels were related to global hyperkinesia but not to psychopathology ratings .
15764424	4	680	Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role , intensity of stimulant - induced psychotic symptoms and stereotypies appears to be at least in part dose - related .
15811908	0	0	Pheochromocytoma unmasked by amisulpride and tiapride .
15811908	1	55	OBJECTIVE : To describe the unmasking of pheochromocytoma in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride .
15811908	2	164	CASE SUMMARY : A 42 - year - old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg .
15811908	3	338	Both drugs were immediately discontinued , and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment .
15811908	4	460	Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass , and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma .
15811908	5	591	DISCUSSION : Drug - induced symptoms of pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs , but the underlying mechanism is unknown .
15811908	6	752	In our case , use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and tiapride therapy .
15811908	7	906	CONCLUSIONS : As of March 24 , 2005 , this is the first reported case of amisulpride - and tiapride - induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with pheochromocytoma .
15811908	8	1066	Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of tiapride and amisulpride .
15814210	0	0	Minor neurological dysfunction , cognitive development , and somatic development at the age of 3 to 7 years after dexamethasone treatment in very - low birth - weight infants .
15814210	1	170	The objective of this study was to assess minor neurological dysfunction , cognitive development , and somatic development after dexamethasone therapy in very - low - birthweight infants .
15814210	2	352	Thirty - three children after dexamethasone treatment were matched to 33 children without dexamethasone treatment .
15814210	3	465	Data were assessed at the age of 3 - 7 years .
15814210	4	509	Dexamethasone was started between the 7th and the 28th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2 . 35 mg / kg / day .
15814210	5	625	Exclusion criteria were asphyxia , malformations , major surgical interventions , small for gestational age , intraventricular haemorrhage grades III and IV , periventricular leukomalacia , and severe psychomotor retardation .
15814210	6	845	Each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor neurological dysfunctions and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and a Draw - a - Man Test .
15814210	7	1053	There were no differences in demographic data , growth , and socio - economic status between the two groups .
15814210	8	1158	Fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
15814210	9	1258	In the Draw - a - Man Test , the control group showed better results ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
15814210	10	1333	There were no differences in development of speech , social development , and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children .
15814210	11	1454	After dexamethasone treatment , children showed a higher rate of minor neurological dysfunctions .
15814210	12	1551	Neurological development was affected even without neurological diagnosis .
15814210	13	1626	Further long - term follow - up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of dexamethasone on neurological and cognitive development .
15858223	0	0	Valproic acid I : time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers , liver toxicity , and valproic acid metabolite levels in rats .
15858223	1	124	A single dose of valproic acid ( VPA ) , which is a widely used antiepileptic drug , is associated with oxidative stress in rats , as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - isoprostane ( 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP ) .
15858223	2	335	To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA - associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity , adult male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA ( 500 mg / kg ) or 0 . 9 % saline ( vehicle ) once daily for 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , or 14 days .
15858223	3	583	Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP , lipid hydroperoxides ( LPO ) , and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARs ) .
15858223	4	751	Plasma and liver 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of VPA treatment compared to control .
15858223	5	868	Liver LPO levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment ( 1 . 8 - fold versus control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
15858223	6	965	Liver and plasma TBARs were not increased until 14 days ( 2 - fold vs . control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
15858223	7	1053	Liver toxicity was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha - glutathione S - transferase ( alpha - GST ) and by histology .
15858223	8	1169	Serum alpha - GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4 , which corresponded to hepatotoxicity as shown by the increasing incidence of inflammation of the liver capsule , necrosis , and steatosis throughout the study .
15858223	9	1388	The liver levels of beta - oxidation metabolites of VPA were decreased by day 14 , while the levels of 4 - ene - VPA and ( E ) - 2 , 4 - diene - VPA were not elevated throughout the study .
15858223	10	1560	Overall , these findings indicate that VPA treatment results in oxidative stress , as measured by levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP , which precedes the onset of necrosis , steatosis , and elevated levels of serum alpha - GST .
15867025	0	0	Assessment of perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention in New Hampshire delivery hospitals .
15867025	1	96	OBJECTIVE : To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention practices in New Hampshire .
15867025	2	227	METHODS : Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother - infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire ' s 25 delivery hospitals .
15867025	3	368	Assessment was done on the following : prenatal screening for hepatitis B and rubella , administration of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose to all infants , administration of hepatitis B immune globulin to infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen - positive mothers , rubella immunity , and administration of in - hospital postpartum rubella vaccine to rubella nonimmune women .
15867025	4	750	RESULTS : Prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B ( 98 . 8 % ) and rubella ( 99 . 4 % ) were high .
15867025	5	839	Hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was administered to 76 . 2 % of all infants .
15867025	6	912	All infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen - positive mothers also received hepatitis B immune globulin .
15867025	7	1029	Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination .
15867025	8	1176	The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 ( 48 . 5 % and 67 . 5 % , respectively ) was less than any other months , whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 ( 88 . 2 % ) was the highest .
15867025	9	1400	Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of rubella nonimmunity ( 9 . 5 % ) .
15867025	10	1494	In - hospital postpartum rubella vaccine administration was documented for 75 . 6 % of nonimmune women .
15867025	11	1593	CONCLUSION : This study documents good compliance in New Hampshire ' s birthing hospitals with national guidelines for perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention and highlights potential areas for improvement .
15893386	0	0	Succinylcholine - induced masseter muscle rigidity during bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body .
15893386	1	106	Masseter muscle rigidity during general anesthesia is considered an early warning sign of a possible episode of malignant hyperthermia .
15893386	2	242	The decision whether to continue or discontinue the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgery and severity of masseter muscle rigidity .
15893386	3	384	Here , we describe a case of severe masseter muscle rigidity ( jaw of steel ) after succinylcholine ( Sch ) administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body .
15893386	4	599	Anesthesia was continued uneventfully with propofol infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat malignant hyperthermia .
15897593	0	0	Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage - enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not doxorubicin .
15897593	1	132	PURPOSE : The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage - enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology ; however , myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use .
15897593	2	373	Dexrazoxane ( ICRF - 187 ) is recommended for protection against anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity .
15897593	3	472	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Because of their widespread use , the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated : Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide , daunorubicin , and doxorubicin + / - dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte - macrophage colony forming assays .
15897593	4	852	Likewise , in vivo , B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide , daunorubicin , and doxorubicin , with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses : posttreatment , a full hematologic evaluation was done .
15897593	5	1054	RESULTS : Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay ; however , dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression , weight loss , nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin .
15897593	6	1359	CONCLUSION : Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically , the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern ; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention .
15897593	7	1679	Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane .
15897593	8	1791	Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity .
15897593	9	1979	If successful , this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy .
15930398	0	0	Assessment of the onset and persistence of amnesia during procedural sedation with propofol .
15930398	1	93	OBJECTIVES : To assess patients ' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with propofol , and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index ( BIS ) monitoring .
15930398	2	337	METHODS : This was a prospective , single - intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28 , 2002 , and October 31 , 2003 .
15930398	3	519	BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status .
15930398	4	658	At 1 - minute intervals during the procedural sedation , until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure , a word from a standardized list was read aloud , and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator .
15930398	5	917	The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient ' s ability to repeat the word were recorded .
15930398	6	1021	After the procedure , the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall , and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed .
15930398	7	1281	RESULTS : Seventy - five consenting patients were enrolled ; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation .
15930398	8	1408	No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations .
15930398	9	1478	The mean ( + / - standard deviation ) time of data collection was 16 . 4 minutes ( + / - 7 . 1 ; range 5 to 34 minutes ) .
15930398	10	1585	The mean initial ( preprocedure ) BIS score was 97 . 1 ( + / - 2 . 3 ; range 92 to 99 ) .
15930398	11	1662	The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66 . 9 ( + / - 14 . 4 ; range 33 to 91 ) .
15930398	12	1768	The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77 . 1 ( 95 % CI = 74 . 3 to 80 . 0 ) .
15930398	13	1919	The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81 . 5 ( 95 % CI = 78 . 1 to 84 . 8 ) .
15930398	14	2027	The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96 . 7 ( + / - 2 . 4 ; range 84 to 98 ) .
15930398	15	2166	The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 88 . 1 to 94 . 3 ) .
15930398	16	2294	All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol .
15930398	17	2382	The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91 . 5 ( + / - 11 . 1 ; range 79 to 98 ) , and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90 .
15930398	18	2544	CONCLUSIONS : There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words .
15930398	19	2709	Furthermore , patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation , suggestive of retrograde amnesia .
1595783	0	0	Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity .
1595783	1	31	Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side - effects , the most problematic being pneumonitis .
1595783	2	166	The pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell - mediated hypersensitivity pneumonitis .
1595783	3	351	The clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone - induced pulmonary toxicity are characteristic but nonspecific .
1595783	4	467	The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities , such as heart failure , infection , and malignancy .
1595783	5	571	While withdrawal of amiodarone leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases , this is not always possible or advisable .
1595783	6	696	Dose reduction or concomitant steroid therapy may have a role in selected patients .
15974569	0	0	Two prodrugs of potent and selective GluR5 kainate receptor antagonists actives in three animal models of pain .
15974569	1	112	Amino acids 5 and 7 , two potent and selective competitive GluR5 KA receptor antagonists , exhibited high GluR5 receptor affinity over other glutamate receptors .
15974569	2	272	Their ester prodrugs 6 and 8 were orally active in three models of pain : reversal of formalin - induced paw licking , carrageenan - induced thermal hyperalgesia , and capsaicin - induced mechanical hyperalgesia .
15985056	0	0	Possible azithromycin - associated hiccups .
15985056	1	42	OBJECTIVE : To report a case of persistent hiccups associated by azithromycin therapy .
15985056	2	128	CASE SUMMARY : A 76 - year - old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of pharyngitis .
15985056	3	257	Hiccups were persistent and exhausting .
15985056	4	297	Discontinuation of azithromycin and therapy with baclofen finally resolved hiccups .
15985056	5	381	No organic cause of hiccups was identified despite extensive investigation .
15985056	6	457	DISCUSSION : Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with hiccups .
15985056	7	542	Corticosteroids ( dexamethasone and methylprednisolone ) , benzodiazepines ( midazolam ) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of hiccups .
15985056	8	777	Few cases of drug - induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials .
15985056	9	867	Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible ( score 5 points ) , mostly because of the close temporal sequence , previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups .
15985056	10	1151	Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient .
15985056	11	1270	CONCLUSIONS : Diagnosis of drug - induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination .
15985056	12	1383	However , macrolide antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side - effect .
16006300	0	0	Calcium carbonate toxicity : the updated milk - alkali syndrome ; report of 3 cases and review of the literature .
16006300	1	110	OBJECTIVE : To describe 3 patients with calcium carbonate - induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk - alkali syndrome .
16006300	2	266	METHODS : We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia ( corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg / dL ) and review the pertinent literature on milk - alkali syndrome .
16006300	3	475	RESULTS : The 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency , relative metabolic alkalosis , and low parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , PTH - related peptide , and 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations .
16006300	4	660	No malignant lesion was found .
16006300	5	691	Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide .
16006300	6	765	The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously ( 60 and 30 mg , respectively ) , which caused severe hypocalcemia .
16006300	7	924	Of the 3 patients , 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental calcium ( 1 g and 2 g daily , respectively ) in the form of calcium carbonate .
16006300	8	1066	In addition to our highlighted cases , we review the history , classification , pathophysiologic features , and treatment of milk - alkali syndrome and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003 .
16006300	9	1275	CONCLUSION : Milk - alkali syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons .
16006300	10	1461	Treatment with hydration , furosemide , and discontinuation of the calcium and vitamin D source is adequate .
16006300	11	1568	Pamidronate treatment is associated with considerable risk for hypocalcemia , even in cases of initially severe hypercalcemia .
16047871	0	0	Warfarin - induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis .
16047871	1	46	Skin reactions associated with oral coumarin - derived anticoagulants are an uncommon occurrence .
16047871	2	142	Leukocytoclastic vasculitis ( LV ) is primarily a cutaneous small vessel vasculitis , though systemic involvement may be encountered .
16047871	3	273	We report 4 patients with late - onset LV probably due to warfarin .
16047871	4	339	All 4 patients presented with skin eruptions that developed after receiving warfarin for several years .
16047871	5	443	The results of skin lesion biopsies were available in 3 patients , confirming LV Cutaneous lesions resolved in all patients after warfarin was discontinued .
16047871	6	599	In 2 of the 4 patients , rechallenge with warfarin led to recurrence of the lesions .
16047871	7	683	LV may be a late - onset adverse reaction associated with warfarin therapy .
1610717	0	0	Cocaine - induced brainstem seizures and behavior .
1610717	1	49	A variety of abnormal sensory / motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical ( electrode implants ) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine .
1610717	2	328	The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations .
1610717	3	481	Cocaine ( 40 mg / kg ) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study .
1610717	4	625	Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group , especially the electrically perturbated subjects .
1610717	5	754	The abnormal behaviors were yawning , retrocollis , hyperactivity , hypersensitivity , " beating drum " behavior , squealing , head bobbing , circling , sniffing , abnormal posturing , and facial twitching .
1610717	6	949	Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states .
1610717	7	1068	Hypersensitivity to various auditory , tactile , and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation .
1610717	8	1256	These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation .
1610717	9	1414	Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates .
1610717	10	1597	Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated .
16116131	0	0	rTMS of supplementary motor area modulates therapy - induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease .
16116131	1	93	The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in levodopa - induced dyskinesia are unclear .
16116131	2	182	Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) over the supplementary motor area ( SMA ) in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson disease , the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a dyskinetic state induced by continuous apomorphine infusion .
16116131	3	495	rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce drug - induced dyskinesias , whereas 5 - Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase .
16132524	0	0	Intracavitary chemotherapy ( paclitaxel / carboplatin liquid crystalline cubic phases ) for recurrent glioblastoma - - clinical observations .
16132524	1	137	Human malignant brain tumors have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy .
16132524	2	231	Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers , separating two congruent networks of water channels .
16132524	3	345	Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs , the gel - like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity .
16132524	4	468	For human glioblastoma recurrences , the feasibility , safety , and short - term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study .
16132524	5	701	A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a glioblastoma multiforme underwent re - resection and received an intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin cubic phases in different dosages .
16132524	6	901	Six of the patients received more than 15 mg paclitaxel and suffered from moderate to severe brain edema , while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg paclitaxel .
16132524	7	1079	In the latter group , brain edema was markedly reduced and dealt medically .
16132524	8	1154	Intracavitary chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma using cubic phases is feasible and safe , yet the clinical benefit remains to be examined in a clinical phase II study .
16157917	0	0	Lamotrigine associated with exacerbation or de novo myoclonus in idiopathic generalized epilepsies .
16157917	1	100	Five patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies ( IGE ) treated with lamotrigine ( LTG ) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of myoclonic jerks ( MJ ) .
16157917	2	262	In three patients , LTG exacerbated MJ in a dose - dependent manner with early aggravation during titration .
16157917	3	368	MJ disappeared when LTG dose was decreased by 25 to 50 % .
16157917	4	425	In two patients , LTG exacerbated MJ in a delayed but more severe manner , with myoclonic status that only ceased after LTG withdrawal .
16174948	0	0	Absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after cocaine - associated subarachnoid hemorrhage .
16174948	1	93	INTRODUCTION : Cocaine use has been associated with neurovascular complications , including arterial vasoconstriction and vasculitis .
16174948	2	225	However , there are few studies of angiographic effects of cocaine on human cerebral arteries .
16174948	3	319	Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine - associated subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use .
16174948	4	501	METHODS : We screened patients with SAH retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites .
16174948	5	640	Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with SAH who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter .
16174948	6	846	Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made .
16174948	7	910	RESULTS : Thirteen patients with positive cocaine toxicology were compared to 26 controls .
16174948	8	1000	There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid , sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral , precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral , or basilar arteries ( p greater than 0 . 05 for all comparisons , unpaired t - tests ) .
16174948	9	1286	There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery ( p greater than 0 . 05 , unpaired t - tests ) .
16174948	10	1642	Qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group .
16174948	11	1742	CONCLUSION : No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or vasculitis could be found in patients who underwent angiography after aneurysmal SAH associated with cocaine use .
16192988	0	0	Methamphetamine causes alterations in the MAP kinase - related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased aggressiveness .
16192988	1	131	Aggressive behaviors have been reported in patients who suffer from some psychiatric disorders , and are common in methamphetamine ( METH ) abusers .
16192988	2	277	Herein , we report that multiple ( but not single ) injections of METH significantly increased aggressiveness in male CD - 1 mice .
16192988	3	403	This increase in aggressiveness was not secondary to METH - induced hyperactivity .
16192988	4	484	Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase - related pathways after multiple and single METH injections .
16192988	5	667	There were statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decreases in MEK1 , Erk2p , GSK3alpha , 14 - 3 - 3e , and MEK7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of METH .
16192988	6	826	MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of METH , but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of METH .
16192988	7	966	In the frontal cortex , there was a statistically significant decrease in GSK3alpha after multiple ( but not single ) injections of METH .
16192988	8	1101	These findings suggest that alterations in MAP kinase - related pathways in the prefronto - striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of aggressive behaviors in mice .
16225977	0	0	Amisulpride related tic - like symptoms in an adolescent schizophrenic .
16225977	1	70	Tic disorders can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone , olanzapine and ziprasidone .
16225977	2	187	However , there are two case reports that show tic - like symptoms , including motor and phonic variants , occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine .
16225977	3	346	We present a 15 - year - old girl schizophrenic who developed frequent involuntary eye - blinking movements after 5 months of amisulpride treatment ( 1000 mg per day ) .
16225977	4	507	The tic - like symptoms resolved completely after we reduced the dose of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day .
16225977	5	614	However , her psychosis recurred after the dose reduction .
16225977	6	672	We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of quetiapine .
16225977	7	738	She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function .
16225977	8	863	No more tic - like symptoms or other side effects have been reported .
16225977	9	931	Together with previously reported cases , our patient suggests that tic - like symptoms might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine , clozapine , or amisulpride .
1628552	0	0	Chloroquine related complete heart block with blindness : case report .
1628552	1	70	A 27 - year old African woman with history of regular chloroquine ingestion presented with progressive deterioration of vision , easy fatiguability , dyspnoea , dizziness progressing to syncopal attacks .
1628552	2	269	Ophthalmological assessment revealed features of chloroquine retinopathy , cardiac assessment revealed features of heart failure and a complete heart block with right bundle branch block pattern .
1628552	3	464	The heart block was treated by pacemaker insertion and the heart failure resolved spontaneously following chloroquine discontinuation .
1628552	4	599	She however remains blind .
1636026	0	0	Effects of suprofen on the isolated perfused rat kidney .
1636026	1	57	Although suprofen has been associated with the development of acute renal failure in greater than 100 subjects , the mechanism of damage remains unclear .
1636026	2	210	The direct nephrotoxic effects of a single dose of 15 mg of suprofen were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell - free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg / dL of uric acid .
1636026	3	419	There were no significant differences in renal sodium excretion , oxygen consumption , or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with suprofen compared with the drug - free control groups .
1636026	4	604	In contrast , a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of suprofen to the kidney perfused with uric acid ; no changes were found with suprofen in the absence of uric acid .
1636026	5	818	A significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of uric acid was found in rats given suprofen , compared with drug - free controls .
1636026	6	953	However , the fractional excretion of uric acid was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period .
1636026	7	1063	In summary , suprofen causes acute declines in renal function , most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of uric acid .
16364460	0	0	Microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of hippocampus improves scopolamine - induced amnesia in adult male rats .
16364460	1	121	The effect of ritanserin ( 5 - HT2 antagonist ) on scopolamine ( muscarinic cholinergic antagonist ) - induced amnesia in Morris water maze ( MWM ) was investigated .
16364460	2	277	Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus .
16364460	3	376	One week later , they received repeatedly vehicles ( saline , DMSO , saline + DMSO ) , scopolamine ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl saline / side ; 30 min before training ) , ritanserin ( 2 , 4 and 8 microg / 0 . 5 microl DMSO / side ; 20 min before training ) and scopolamine ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl ; 30 min before ritanserin injection ) + ritanserin ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl DMSO ) through cannulae each day .
16364460	4	741	Animals were tested for four consecutive days ( 4 trial / day ) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged .
16364460	5	868	In the fifth day , the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor , motivational and visual systems .
16364460	6	1024	The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in scopolamine - treated group as compared to saline group .
16364460	7	1184	Ritanserin - treated rats ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl / side ) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to DMSO - treated group .
16364460	8	1328	However , scopolamine and ritanserin co - administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the scopolamine - treated rats .
16364460	9	1505	Our findings show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine - induced amnesia .
16418614	0	0	PTU - associated vasculitis in a girl with Turner Syndrome and Graves ' disease .
16418614	1	78	Palpable purpura is a concerning clinical finding in pediatric patients and can have many causes , including infectious and autoimmune processes .
16418614	2	223	A rare cause , drug - induced vasculitis , may result from the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ANCAs ) in response to a medication .
16418614	3	371	We report a girl with Turner syndrome and Graves ' disease who presented with palpable purpuric lesions .
16418614	4	475	The diagnosis of propylthiouracil ( PTU ) - associated vasculitis was made by observation of consistent clinical features , the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood , and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of PTU .
16418614	5	725	Subsequent treatment of persistent hyperthyroidism with radioablation did not result in an exacerbation of the vasculitis , a complication described in prior case reports .
16428827	0	0	Daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase from MC - IXC cells and improves drug - induced amnesia .
16428827	1	98	The choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) activator , which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine ( ACh ) , is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) .
16428827	2	327	Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect ( 46 % ) on ChAT in vitro .
16428827	3	429	Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana , the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein ( 4 ' , 7 - dihydroxy - isoflavone ) .
16428827	4	572	In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine - induced impairments of learning and memory , we conducted a series of in vivo tests .
16428827	5	746	Administration of daidzein ( 4 . 5 mg / kg body weight ) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine - induced amnesia , according to the results of a Y - maze test .
16428827	6	912	Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y - maze tests ( a 37 % decreases in alternation behavior ) .
16428827	7	1040	By way of contrast , mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment ( an approximately 12 % - 21 % decrease in alternation behavior ) .
16428827	8	1243	These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator , and that it also ameliorates scopolamine - induced amnesia .

16471092	10	1107	The SF - 36 scores changed significantly in the domains of physical functioning , role function emotional , social function and mental heath .
16471092	11	1245	CONCLUSION : Tolterodine was well tolerated and its effects improved the quality of life in Thai women with OAB .
16563323	0	0	Remifentanil pretreatment reduces myoclonus after etomidate .
16563323	1	61	STUDY OBJECTIVE : The aim of the study was to compare the effect of pretreatment with remifentanil 1 microg / kg and the effect of gender on the incidence of myoclonus after anesthesia induction with etomidate .
16563323	2	269	DESIGN : This was a randomized , double - blind study .
16563323	3	320	SETTING : The study was conducted at a university hospital .
16563323	4	379	PATIENTS : Sixty patients were pretreated in a randomized double - blinded fashion with remifentanil 1 microg / kg or placebo .
16563323	5	501	Two minutes after remifentanil or placebo injection , etomidate 0 . 3 mg / kg was given .
16563323	6	585	MEASUREMENTS : Myoclonus was recorded with a scale of 0 to 3 .
16563323	7	646	The grade of sedation ( none , mild , moderate , severe ) , nausea , pruritus , and apnea were recorded after injection of both drugs .
16563323	8	773	MAIN RESULTS : The incidence of myoclonus was significantly lower in the remifentanil group ( 6 . 7 % ) than in the placebo group ( 70 % ) ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
16563323	9	916	None of the patients experienced sedation , apnea , nausea , or pruritus after injection of both drugs .
16563323	10	1017	In the placebo group , male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of myoclonus after etomidate administration .
16563323	11	1153	CONCLUSION : Pretreatment with remifentanil 1 microg / kg reduced myoclonus after etomidate induction without side effects such as sedation , apnea , nausea , or pruritus .

16574713	0	0	Memory function and serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism in ecstasy ( MDMA ) users .
16574713	1	94	Although 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA or ecstasy ) has been shown to damage brain serotonin ( 5 - HT ) neurons in animals and possibly humans , little is known about the long - term consequences of MDMA - induced 5 - HT neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5 - HT is involved , such as cognitive function .
16574713	2	400	Because 5 - HT transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5 - HT transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5 - HT transporter promoter gene region ( 5 - HTTLPR ) when studying the effects of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning .
16574713	3	702	The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use on cognitive function , as well as the effects of long - term abstention from MDMA , in subjects genotyped for 5 - HTTLPR .
16574713	4	902	A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males .
16574713	5	997	Fifteen moderate MDMA users ( < 55 lifetime tablets ) , 22 heavy MDMA + users ( > 55 lifetime tablets ) , 16 ex - MDMA + users ( last tablet > 1 year ago ) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests .
16574713	6	1211	DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5 - HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods . A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks ( p = 0 . 04 ) but not on reaction times ( p = 0 . 61 ) or attention / executive functioning ( p = 0 . 59 ) .
16574713	7	1492	Heavy and ex - MDMA + users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls .
16574713	8	1579	In contrast , no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users .
16574713	9	1662	No significant effect of 5 - HTTLPR or gender was observed .
16574713	10	1720	While the use of MDMA in quantities that may be considered " moderate " is not associated with impaired memory functioning , heavy use of MDMA use may lead to long lasting memory impairments .
16574713	11	1909	No effect of 5 - HTTLPR or gender on memory function or MDMA use was observed .
16584858	0	0	Role of mangiferin on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
16584858	1	125	The current study dealt with the protective role of mangiferin , a polyphenol from Mangifera indica Linn . ( Anacardiaceae ) , on isoproterenol ( ISPH ) - induced myocardial infarction ( MI ) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism .
16584858	2	351	Subcutaneous injection of ISPH ( 200 mg / kg body weight in 1 ml saline ) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused myocardial damage in rat heart , which was determined by the increased activity of serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes ( CK - MB ) , increased uric acid level and reduced plasma iron binding capacity .
16584858	3	690	The protective role of mangiferin was analyzed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ( TTC ) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the ischemic myocardium .
16584858	4	852	The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase activities , non - enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin , Vitamin C , Vitamin E and glutathione levels were altered in MI rats .
16584858	5	1133	Upon pretreatment with mangiferin ( 100 mg / kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide ) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to MI rats protected the above - mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels .
16584858	6	1352	Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non - enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon mangiferin administration as compared to ISPH - induced MI rats .
16584858	7	1529	From the present study it is concluded that mangiferin exerts a beneficial effect against ISPH - induced MI due to its antioxidant potential , which regulated the tissues defense system against cardiac damage .
16586083	0	0	Cardiovascular risk with cyclooxygenase inhibitors : general problem with substance specific differences ?
16586083	1	105	Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction , stroke , hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors .
16586083	2	301	Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly , but not exclusively , in patients with concomitant risk factors .
16586083	3	413	Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal , vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention .
16586083	4	572	The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time .
16586083	5	682	A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance - specific differences , which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin - independent effects .
16586083	6	947	Diagnostic markers such as N - terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide ( NT - proBNP ) or high - sensitive C - reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk , thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity .
16596970	0	0	Pilocarpine seizures cause age - dependent impairment in auditory location discrimination .
16596970	1	89	Children who have status epilepticus have continuous or rapidly repeating seizures that may be life - threatening and may cause life - long changes in brain and behavior .
16596970	2	256	The extent to which status epilepticus causes deficits in auditory discrimination is unknown .
16596970	3	350	A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus .
16596970	4	485	Male Sprague - Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day ( P ) 20 , or a convulsant dose of pilocarpine on P20 or P45 .
16596970	5	612	Pilocarpine on either day induced status epilepticus ; status epilepticus at P45 resulted in CA3 cell loss and spontaneous seizures , whereas P20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous seizures .
16596970	6	803	Mature rats were trained with sound - source location and sound - silence discriminations .
16596970	7	890	Control ( saline P20 ) rats acquired both discriminations immediately .
16596970	8	959	In status epilepticus ( P20 ) rats , acquisition of the sound - source location discrimination was moderately impaired .
16596970	9	1074	Status epilepticus ( P45 ) rats failed to acquire either sound - source location or sound - silence discriminations .
16596970	10	1185	Status epilepticus in rat causes an age - dependent , long - term impairment in auditory discrimination .
16596970	11	1285	This impairment may explain one cause of impaired auditory location discrimination in humans .
16600756	0	0	Nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive bladder .
16600756	1	96	PURPOSE : NGF and PGs in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine .
16600756	2	231	We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with OAB .
16600756	3	297	MATERIALS AND METHODS : The study groups included 65 women with OAB and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls .
16600756	4	420	Evaluation included patient history , urinalysis , a voiding diary and urodynamic studies .
16600756	5	509	Urine samples were collected .
16600756	6	539	NGF , PGE2 , PGF2alpha and PGI2 were measured using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups .
16600756	7	656	In addition , correlations between urinary NGF and PG , and urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB were examined .
16600756	8	772	RESULTS : Urinary NGF , PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with OAB compared with controls ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
16600756	9	897	However , urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with OAB .
16600756	10	977	In patients with OAB urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
16600756	11	1113	Urinary NGF , PGF2alpha and PGI2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB .
16600756	12	1212	CONCLUSIONS : NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of OAB symptoms in female patients .
16600756	13	1313	Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate OAB symptoms .
16629641	0	0	Definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis C virus .
16629641	1	81	Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) can progress to cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma , and end - stage liver disease .
16629641	2	210	The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin .
16629641	3	319	Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses ( SVRs ) in approximately 50 % of patients , it can be associated with a potentially dose - limiting hemolytic anemia .
16629641	4	493	Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin - induced hemolysis , and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection , especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders .
16629641	5	716	In general , anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality , and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life .
16629641	6	857	Although ribavirin - associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation , this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates .
16629641	7	1022	Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin - associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages .
16629641	8	1146	Viramidine , a liver - targeting prodrug of ribavirin , has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C .
16634859	0	0	Impact of alcohol exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measures .
16634859	1	98	BACKGROUND : More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith ( 1973 ) reported on the devastation caused by alcohol exposure on fetal development , the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged .
16634859	2	310	Early identification of fetal alcohol exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes .
16634859	3	412	This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting alcohol - related fetal growth impairment .
16634859	4	511	METHODS : We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention study .
16634859	5	688	The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies .
16634859	6	872	Because intensity of alcohol consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes , separate analyses were conducted for the heavy ( average of > or = 5 drinks per drinking day ) alcohol consumers .
16634859	7	1064	Fetal measures from the heavy - exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal , uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics .
16634859	8	1247	Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and drug abuse .
16634859	9	1407	RESULTS : Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies .
16634859	10	1500	When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies , fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non - alcohol - exposed group , regardless of prior drinking patterns .
16634859	11	1692	Any alcohol consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers .
16634859	12	1924	Amphetamine abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios .
16634859	13	1998	CONCLUSIONS : Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies .
16634859	14	2171	Although the reliance on self - reported drinking is a limitation in this study , these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal alcohol effects .
16710500	0	0	Ethambutol - associated optic neuropathy .
16710500	1	40	INTRODUCTION : Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis , which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia , and can be associated with permanent visual loss .
16710500	2	201	We report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia .
16710500	3	263	CLINICAL PICTURE : Three patients with ethambutol - associated toxic optic neuropathy are described .
16710500	4	361	All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity , colour vision ( Ishihara ) and visual field .
16710500	5	454	The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour , suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm .
16710500	6	546	TREATMENT : Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis , visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months .
16710500	7	658	Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases .
16710500	8	702	In the third case , visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale .
16710500	9	795	OUTCOME : All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function .
16710500	10	863	CONCLUSIONS : Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow - up .
16710500	11	1028	The author postulates that in cases of ethambutol associated chiasmopathy , ethambutol may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm .
16720068	0	0	Possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome related to concomitant treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam .
16720068	1	105	A 74 - year - old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to insomnia , loss of appetite , exhaustion , and agitation .
16720068	2	249	Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1 . 2 mg alprazolam .
16720068	3	340	On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment , the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation , disorientation , and severe muscle rigidity with tremors .
16720068	4	507	The patient had a fever ( 38 . 2 degrees C ) , fluctuating blood pressure ( between 165 / 90 and 130 / 70 mg mm Hg ) , and severe extrapyramidal symptoms .
16720068	5	650	Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase ( 2218 IU / L ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( 134 IU / L ) , alanine aminotransferase ( 78 IU / L ) , and BUN ( 27 . 9 mg / ml ) levels .
16720068	6	830	The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms . 7 days later , the fever disappeared and the patient ' s serum CPK levels were normalized ( 175 IU / L ) .
16720068	7	1000	This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) , thus demonstrating that NMS - like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment .
16720068	8	1182	The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case , indicating a probable relationship between the patient ' s NMS - like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case .
16720068	9	1396	The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected .
16720068	10	1493	Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration , agitation , malnutrition , and exhaustion .
16720068	11	1652	Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from depression .
16725121	0	0	Down - regulation of norepinephrine transporter function induced by chronic administration of desipramine linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local - anesthetics - induced convulsions and the counteraction by co - administration with local anesthetics .
16725121	1	253	Alterations of norepinephrine transporter ( NET ) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to seizures induce by cocaine and local anesthetics were studied in mice .
16725121	2	442	Daily administration of desipramine , an inhibitor of the NET , for 5 days decreased [ ( 3 ) H ] norepinephrine uptake in the P2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex , striatum or amygdalae .
16725121	3	627	Co - administration of lidocaine , bupivacaine or tricaine with desipramine reversed this effect .
16725121	4	722	Daily treatment of cocaine increased [ ( 3 ) H ] norepinephrine uptake into the hippocampus .
16725121	5	809	Daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine - induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine - induced convulsions .
16725121	6	967	Co - administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine .
16725121	7	1135	These results suggest that down - regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine - induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions .
16725121	8	1325	Inhibition of Na ( + ) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine - induced down - regulation of NET function .
16725121	9	1441	Repeated administration of cocaine induces up - regulation of hippocampal NET function .
16725121	10	1527	Desipramine - induced sensitization of lidocaine seizures may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of cocaine .
16820346	0	0	Atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone - induced hypertension in the rat .
16820346	1	83	To assess the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin ( atorva ) on dexamethasone ( dex ) - induced hypertension , 60 male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated with atorva 30 mg / kg / day or tap water for 15 days .
16820346	2	279	Dex increased systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) from 109 + / - 1 . 8 to 135 + / - 0 . 6 mmHg and plasma superoxide ( 5711 + / - 284 . 9 saline , 7931 + / - 392 . 8 U / ml dex , P < 0 . 001 ) .
16820346	3	443	In this prevention study , SBP in the atorva + dex group was increased from 115 + / - 0 . 4 to 124 + / - 1 . 5 mmHg , but this was significantly lower than in the dex - only group ( P ' < 0 . 05 ) .
16820346	4	624	Atorva reversed dex - induced hypertension ( 129 + / - 0 . 6 mmHg , vs . 135 + / - 0 . 6 mmHg P ' < 0 . 05 ) and decreased plasma superoxide ( 7931 + / - 392 . 8 dex , 1187 + / - 441 . 2 atorva + dex , P < 0 . 0001 ) .
16820346	5	811	Plasma nitrate / nitrite ( NOx ) was decreased in dex - treated rats compared to saline - treated rats ( 11 . 2 + / - 1 . 08 microm , 15 . 3 + / - 1 . 17 microm , respectively , P < 0 . 05 ) .
16820346	6	976	Atorva affected neither plasma NOx nor thymus weight .
16820346	7	1030	Thus , atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone - induced hypertension in the rat .
16826348	0	0	Peripheral neuropathy caused by high - dose cytosine arabinoside treatment in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia .
16826348	1	115	The central nervous system toxicity of high - dose cytosine arabinoside is well recognized , but the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported .
16826348	2	311	A 49 - year - old Japanese man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia .
16826348	3	381	After he achieved complete remission , he received high - dose cytosine arabinoside treatment ( 2 g / m2 twice a day for 5 days ; total , 20 g / m2 ) as consolidation therapy .
16826348	4	546	The first course of high - dose cytosine arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms , but on day 21 of the second course of treatment , the patient complained of numbness in his right foot .
16826348	5	733	Electromyogram and nerve - conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves .
16826348	6	831	This neuropathy was gradually resolving ; however , after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation , the symptoms worsened , with the development of graft - versus - host disease , and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone .
16826348	7	1085	Although the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy are still unclear , high - dose cytosine arabinoside is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system , and auto / alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms .
16844102	0	0	Effect of alpha - tocopherol and deferoxamine on methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity .
16844102	1	86	Methamphetamine ( MA ) - induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals .
16844102	2	218	This study examined the effect of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - TC ) , a scavenger of reactive oxygen species , and deferoxamine ( DFO ) , an iron chelator , on the MA - induced neurotoxicity .
16844102	3	396	Male rats were treated with MA ( 10 mg / kg , every 2 h for four injections ) .
16844102	4	470	The rat received either alpha - TC ( 20 mg / kg ) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to MA administration or DFO ( 50 mg / kg ) subcutaneously 30 min before MA administration .
16844102	5	647	The concentrations of dopamine ( DA ) , serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration , which was inhibited by the alpha - TC and DFO pretreatment . alpha - TC and DFO attenuated the MA - induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity .
16844102	6	933	The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA - treated rats .
16844102	7	1052	These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha - TC and DFO .
16844102	8	1117	This suggests that alpha - TC and DFO ameliorate the MA - induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative stress .
1687392	0	0	Blockade of both D - 1 and D - 2 dopamine receptors may induce catalepsy in mice . 1 .
1687392	1	81	The catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists has been tested and the possible dopamine subtypes involved in catalepsy was determined . 2 .
1687392	2	219	Dopamine antagonist fluphenazine , D - 1 antagonist SCH 23390 or D - 2 antagonist sulpiride induced catalepsy .
1687392	3	325	The effect of fluphenazine and sulpiride was dose - dependent .
1687392	4	386	Combination of SCH 23390 with sulpiride did not induce catalepsy potentiation . 3 .
1687392	5	468	D - 1 agonist SKF 38393 or D - 2 agonist quinpirole decreased the catalepsy induced by fluphenazine , SCH 23390 or sulpiride . 4 .
1687392	6	592	Combination of SKF 38393 with quinpirole did not cause potentiated inhibitory effect on catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists . 5 .
1687392	7	726	The data may indicate that although D - 2 receptor blockade is involved in catalepsy , the D - 1 receptor may plan a role .
16960342	0	0	Sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated hepatitis B virus - related cirrhosis after treatment with lamivudine monotherapy .
16960342	1	144	Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection , which causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma , remains a major health problem in Asian countries .
16960342	2	289	Recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers , although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to now .
16960342	3	495	In this report , we encountered a patient with decompensated HBV - related cirrhosis who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy .
16960342	4	642	The patient was a 50 - year - old woman .
16960342	5	679	Previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient , thus this patient had been referred to our hospital .
16960342	6	810	However , the administration of lamivudine , a reverse transcriptase inhibitor , for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity .
16960342	7	944	During this period , no drug resistant mutant HBV emerged , and the serum HBV - DNA level was continuously suppressed .
16960342	8	1059	These virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued .
16960342	9	1159	Moreover , both hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen were observed to have disappeared in this patient .
16960342	10	1267	The administration of lamivudine to patients with HBV - related cirrhosis , like our present case , should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option , especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available .
1700207	0	0	Antiarrhythmic effects of optical isomers of cibenzoline on canine ventricular arrhythmias .
1700207	1	92	Antiarrhythmic effects of ( + ) - cibenzoline and ( - ) - cibenzoline were examined using two canine ventricular arrhythmia models .
1700207	2	216	Digitalis arrhythmia , which is suppressed by Na channel blockers , was induced by intermittent intravenous ( i . v . ) injection of ouabain in pentobarbital - anesthetized dogs .
1700207	3	386	Adrenaline arrhythmia , which is suppressed by Ca channel blockers , was induced by adrenaline infusion in halothane - anesthetized dogs .
1700207	4	520	Ten and 5 mg / kg i . v . ( + ) - cibenzoline suppressed digitalis - and adrenaline - induced arrhythmias , respectively .
1700207	5	629	The minimum effective plasma concentrations of ( + ) - cibenzoline for digitalis - and adrenaline - induced arrhythmias were 1 . 4 + / - 0 . 4 and 2 . 0 + / - 0 . 6 micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - SD , n = 6 ) .
1700207	6	825	A lower dose of 1 mg / kg i . v . of ( - ) - cibenzoline suppressed the digitalis - induced arrhythmia , whereas 5 mg / kg i . v . was needed to suppress adrenaline - induced arrhythmias .
1700207	7	994	The minimum effective plasma concentrations of ( - ) - cibenzoline for digitalis - and adrenaline - induced arrhythmia were 0 . 06 + / - 0 . 04 and 0 . 7 + / - 0 . 1 micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - SD , n = 6 ) .
1700207	8	1191	The stronger antiarrhythmic effect of ( - ) - cibenzoline indicates that ( - ) - isomer may have an effect nearly 5 - 20 times stronger in suppressing Na channels , but effects of both drugs on Ca channels may be almost equipotent .
17019386	0	0	Passage of mannitol into the brain around gliomas : a potential cause of rebound phenomenon .
17019386	1	92	A study on 21 patients .
17019386	2	116	AIM : Widespread use of mannitol to reduce brain edema and lower elevated ICP in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so - called rebound phenomenon .
17019386	3	280	Leakage of mannitol into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound .
17019386	4	435	This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals .
17019386	5	494	As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of mannitol into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients .
17019386	6	646	METHODS : Mannitol ( 18 % solution ; 1 g / kg ) was administered as a bolus to patients ( ten had malignant glioma , seven brain metastases and four meningioma ) about 30 minutes before craniotomy .
17019386	7	834	During resection , a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample .
17019386	8	962	Mannitol concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al .
17019386	9	1089	RESULTS : In most glioma patients , mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma ( mean 3 . 5 times ) .
17019386	10	1221	In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of mannitol were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells .
17019386	11	1399	CONCLUSIONS : The results of our study show that even after a single bolus , mannitol may leak through the altered BBB near gliomas , reversing the initial plasma - to - blood osmotic gradient , aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of ICP .
17042884	0	0	Placebo - level incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) with quetiapine in controlled studies of patients with bipolar mania .
17042884	1	127	OBJECTIVES : To evaluate extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) , including akathisia , with quetiapine in patients with bipolar mania .
17042884	2	251	METHODS : Data were analyzed from four similarly designed , randomized , double - blind , 3 - to 12 - week studies .
17042884	3	358	Two studies evaluated quetiapine monotherapy ( up to 800 mg / day ) ( n = 209 ) versus placebo ( n = 198 ) , with lithium or haloperidol monotherapy as respective active controls .
17042884	4	529	Two studies evaluated quetiapine ( up to 800 mg / day ) in combination with a mood stabilizer ( lithium or divalproex , QTP + Li / DVP ) ( n = 196 ) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer ( PBO + Li / DVP ) ( n = 203 ) .
17042884	5	733	Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated using the Simpson - Angus Scale ( SAS ) , the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) , adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage .
17042884	6	905	RESULTS : The incidence of EPS - related adverse events , including akathisia , was no different with quetiapine monotherapy ( 12 . 9 % ) than with placebo ( 13 . 1 % ) .
17042884	7	1060	Similarly , EPS - related adverse events with QTP + Li / DVP ( 21 . 4 % ) were no different than with PBO + Li / DVP ( 19 . 2 % ) .
17042884	8	1174	Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59 . 6 % of patients treated with haloperidol ( n = 99 ) monotherapy , whereas 26 . 5 % of patients treated with lithium ( n = 98 ) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS .
17042884	9	1392	The incidence of akathisia was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy ( 3 . 3 % ) and placebo ( 6 . 1 % ) , and with QTP + Li / DVP ( 3 . 6 % ) and PBO + Li / DVP ( 4 . 9 % ) .
17042884	10	1548	Lithium was associated with a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 05 ) of tremor ( 18 . 4 % ) than quetiapine ( 5 . 6 % ) ; cerebellar tremor , which is a known adverse effect of lithium , may have contributed to the elevated rate of tremor in patients receiving lithium therapy .
17042884	11	1816	Haloperidol induced a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 001 ) of akathisia ( 33 . 3 % versus 5 . 9 % ) , tremor ( 30 . 3 % versus 7 . 8 % ) , and extrapyramidal syndrome ( 35 . 4 % versus 5 . 9 % ) than quetiapine .
17042884	12	2008	No significant differences were observed between quetiapine and placebo on SAS and BARS scores .
17042884	13	2104	Anticholinergic use was low and similar with quetiapine or placebo .
17042884	14	2172	CONCLUSIONS : In bipolar mania , the incidence of EPS , including akathisia , with quetiapine therapy is similar to that with placebo .
17049862	0	0	Is phenytoin administration safe in a hypothermic child ?
17049862	1	57	A male neonate with a Chiari malformation and a leaking myelomeningocoele underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by repair of myelomeningocoele .
17049862	2	219	During anaesthesia and surgery , he inadvertently became moderately hypothermic .
17049862	3	299	Intravenous phenytoin was administered during the later part of the surgery for seizure prophylaxis .
17049862	4	400	Following phenytoin administration , the patient developed acute severe bradycardia , refractory to atropine and adrenaline .
17049862	5	523	The cardiac depressant actions of phenytoin and hypothermia can be additive .
17049862	6	600	Administration of phenytoin in the presence of hypothermia may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children .
17049862	7	709	As phenytoin is a commonly used drug , clinicians need to be aware of this interaction .
17074608	0	0	Valproate - induced chorea and encephalopathy in atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia .
17074608	1	84	Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments .
17074608	2	277	In the classical form it presents as neonatal apnea , intractable seizures , and hypotonia , followed by significant psychomotor retardation .
17074608	3	416	An important subset of children with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner .
17074608	4	541	This report describes a patient with mild language delay and mental retardation , who was found to have nonketotic hyperglycinemia following her presentation with acute encephalopathy and chorea shortly after initiation of valproate therapy .
1711760	0	0	Delayed institution of hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia : effect on brain edema .
1711760	1	91	The effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2 - h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studied .
1711760	2	268	Under isoflurane anesthesia , the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded .
1711760	3	357	In the control group ( n = 7 ) , the mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) was not manipulated .
1711760	4	441	In the hypertensive group ( n = 7 ) , the MAP was elevated by 25 - 30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO .
1711760	5	538	Four hours after MCAO , the rats were killed and the brains harvested .
1711760	6	608	The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO .
1711760	7	711	Specific gravity ( SG ) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex ( core and periphery of the ischemic territory ) .
1711760	8	844	The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium staining .
1711760	9	929	In the ischemic core , there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups .
1711760	10	1028	In the periphery of the ischemic territory , SG in the cortex was greater ( less edema accumulation ) in the hypertensive group ( 1 . 041 + / - 0 . 001 vs 1 . 039 + / - 0 . 001 , P less than 0 . 05 ) .
1711760	11	1209	The area of histochemical injury ( as a percent of the cross - sectional area of the hemisphere ) was less in the hypertensive group ( 33 + / - 3 % vs 21 + / - 2 % , P less than 0 . 05 ) .
1711760	12	1382	The data indicate that phenylephrine - induced hypertension instituted 2 h after MCAO does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core , that it improves edema in the periphery of the ischemic territory , and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction .
17194457	0	0	Behavioral effects of pubertal anabolic androgenic steroid exposure in male rats with low serotonin .
17194457	1	101	The goal of this study was to assess the interactive effects of chronic anabolic androgenic steroid ( AAS ) exposure and brain serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine , 5 - HT ) depletion on behavior of pubertal male rats .
17194457	2	309	Serotonin was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine ( PCPA 100 mg / kg , every other day ) ; controls received saline .
17194457	3	452	At puberty ( P40 ) , half the PCPA - treated rats and half the saline - treated rats began treatment with testosterone ( T , 5 mg / kg , 5 days / week ) .
17194457	4	591	Behavioral measures included locomotion , irritability , copulation , partner preference , and aggression .
17194457	5	694	Animals were tested for aggression in their home cage , both with and without physical provocation ( mild tail pinch ) .
17194457	6	811	Brain levels of 5 - HT and its metabolite , 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5 - HIAA ) , were determined using HPLC .
17194457	7	917	PCPA significantly and substantially depleted 5 - HT and 5 - HIAA in all brain regions examined .
17194457	8	1010	Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5 - HT and 5 - HIAA in certain brain areas , but to a much lesser extent than PCPA .
17194457	9	1133	Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior , partner preference , or aggression .
17194457	10	1307	T alone had no effect on locomotion , irritability , or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression .
17194457	11	1426	The most striking effect of combining T + PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack , particularly following physical provocation .
17194457	12	1623	Based on these data , it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5 - HT may be especially prone to exhibit aggressive behavior .
17241657	0	0	Effects of UMB24 and ( + / - ) - SM 21 , putative sigma2 - preferring antagonists , on behavioral toxic and stimulant effects of cocaine in mice .
17241657	1	136	Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the convulsive , lethal , locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of cocaine in mice .
17241657	2	305	In contrast , the contribution of sigma2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are unavailable .
17241657	3	445	To begin addressing this need , we characterized UMB24 ( 1 - ( 2 - phenethyl ) - 4 - ( 2 - pyridyl ) - piperazine ) and ( + / - ) - SM 21 ( 3alpha - tropanyl - 2 - ( 4 - chorophenoxy ) butyrate ) in receptor binding and behavioral studies .
17241657	4	647	Receptor binding studies confirmed that UMB24 and ( + / - ) - SM 21 display preferential affinity for sigma2 over sigma1 receptors .
17241657	5	773	In behavioral studies , pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with UMB24 or ( + / - ) - SM 21 significantly attenuated cocaine - induced convulsions and locomotor activity , but not lethality .
17241657	6	953	When administered alone , ( + / - ) - SM 21 produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline , but UMB24 had locomotor depressant actions .
17241657	7	1108	Together , the data suggest that sigma2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of cocaine , and further development of more selective , high affinity ligands are warranted .
17263743	0	0	Cardiac arrest in a child with cerebral palsy undergoing sevoflurane induction of anesthesia after preoperative clonidine .
17263743	1	123	Clonidine is a frequently administered alpha2 - adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure .
17263743	2	238	We present a case of a 5 - year - old child with cerebral palsy and seizure disorder , receiving clonidine for restlessness , who presented for placement of a baclofen pump .
17263743	3	406	Without the knowledge of the medical personnel , the patient ' s mother administered three doses of clonidine during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce anxiety .
17263743	4	581	During induction of anesthesia , the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension requiring cardiac resuscitation .
17263743	5	696	There are no previous reports of clonidine - associated cardiac arrest in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia .
17285209	0	0	Angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor - associated angioedema of the stomach and small intestine : a case report .
17285209	1	119	This is a case report on a 45 - year old African - American female with newly diagnosed hypertension , who was started on a combination pill of amlodipine / benazapril 10 / 5 mg .
17285209	2	289	The very next day , she presented at the emergency room ( ER ) with abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting .
17285209	3	391	Physical exam , complete metabolic panel , and hemogram were in the normal range .
17285209	4	471	She was discharged from the ER after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics .
17285209	5	560	However , she returned to the ER the next day with the same complaints .
17285209	6	631	This time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion .
17285209	7	728	CT scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach , duodenum and jejunum , along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity .
17285209	8	877	Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) - induced angioedema was suspected , and anti - hypertensive medications were discontinued .
17285209	9	1011	Her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours , and repeat CT after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of ascites .
17285209	10	1181	The recognition of angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) and angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) intestinal angioedema constitutes a challenge to primary care physicians , internists , emergency room personal and surgeons .
1728915	0	0	Carbamazepine - induced cardiac dysfunction .
1728915	1	43	Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes .
1728915	2	96	A patient with sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block , induced by carbamazepine , prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases .
1728915	3	257	From the analysis of these cases , two distinct forms of carbamazepine - associated cardiac dysfunction emerged .
1728915	4	367	One patient group developed sinus tachycardias in the setting of a massive carbamazepine overdose .
1728915	5	466	The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life - threatening bradyarrhythmias or atrioventricular conduction delay , associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated carbamazepine serum levels .
1728915	6	711	Because carbamazepine is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and psychiatric conditions , the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients .
1732442	0	0	Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy with iodine - 125 - metaiodobenzylguanidine .
1732442	1	135	Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) , an analog of norepinephrine ( NE ) , serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function .
1732442	2	278	Using a rat model of adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy , we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose - dependently in adriamycin cardiomyopathy .
1732442	3	485	The degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment ( 2 mg / kg , once a week ) .
1732442	4	630	There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1 - or 2 - wk treatment groups , isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3 - wk group , frequent scattered degeneration in the 4 - wk group , scattered or focal degeneration in the 5 - wk group , and extensive degeneration in the 8 - wk group .
1732442	5	934	Myocardial accumulation of [ 125I ] MIBG 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less .
1732442	6	1078	However , the 4 - wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall ( 82 % of the control ) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall ( about 66 % of the control : p less than 0 . 05 ) .
1732442	7	1299	In the 5 - wk group , MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35 % and 27 % of that in controls , respectively ( p less than 0 . 001 ) .
1732442	8	1446	In the 8 - wk group , MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18 % and 14 % of that in controls , respectively ( p less than 0 . 001 ) .
1732442	9	1593	Thus , MIBG accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose - dependent manner .
1732442	10	1685	The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment ( scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration ) indicates that MIBG scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy .
17344330	0	0	Syncope and QT prolongation among patients treated with methadone for heroin dependence in the city of Copenhagen .
17344330	1	115	BACKGROUND : Methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts to decrease illicit opioid use .
17344330	2	201	Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes ( TdP ) has been reported in methadone users .
17344330	3	324	As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs , doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of TdP in this special population , and the high mortality in this population may , in part , be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone .
17344330	4	641	METHODS : In this cross - sectional study interview , ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult heroin addicts treated with methadone or buprenorphine on a daily basis .
17344330	5	827	Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen , 450 ( approximately 52 % ) were included .
17344330	6	944	The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs .
17344330	7	993	All participants were interviewed about any experience of syncope .
17344330	8	1060	The association between opioid dose and QT , and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression , respectively .
17344330	9	1237	RESULTS : Methadone dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0 . 140 ms / mg ( p = 0 . 002 ) .
17344330	10	1328	No association between buprenorphine and QTc was found .
17344330	11	1384	Among the subjects treated with methadone , 28 % men and 32 % women had prolonged QTc interval .
17344330	12	1477	None of the subjects treated with buprenorphine had QTc interval > 0 . 440 s ( ( 1 / 2 ) ) .
17344330	13	1559	A 50 mg higher methadone dose was associated with a 1 . 2 ( 95 % CI 1 . 1 to 1 . 4 ) times higher odds for syncope .
17344330	14	1666	CONCLUSIONS : Methadone is associated with QT prolongation and higher reporting of syncope in a population of heroin addicts .
17366349	0	0	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by ziprasidone on the second day of treatment .
17366349	1	86	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) is the rarest and most serious of the neuroleptic - induced movement disorders .
17366349	2	201	We describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) associated with the use of ziprasidone .
17366349	3	300	Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS , atypical antipsychotic drugs like ziprasidone may also be a cause .
17366349	4	443	The patient is a 24 - year - old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80 - mg / day dose of orally administrated ziprasidone .
17366349	5	635	This case is the earliest ( second day of treatment ) NMS due to ziprasidone reported in the literature .
17490790	0	0	Peripheral iron dextran induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat substantia nigra .
17490790	1	94	Iron accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson ' s disease .
17490790	2	185	To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral iron overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra ( SN ) , in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry , tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) immunohistochemistry , Perls ' iron staining , and high performance liquid chromatography - electrochemical detection to study the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased iron content in the SN of iron dextran overloaded animals .
17490790	3	625	The findings showed that peripheral iron dextran overload increased the iron staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH - immunoreactive neurons in the SN .
17490790	4	789	As a result , dopamine release and content , as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen .
17490790	5	903	Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group .
17490790	6	968	These results suggest that peripheral iron dextran can increase the iron level in the SN , where excessive iron causes the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons .
17490790	7	1128	The chronic iron overload may be more destructive to dopaminergic neurons than the acute iron overload .
17490864	0	0	Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent corticosterone treatment in rats .
17490864	1	149	The development of schizophrenia may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events , in combination leading to overt disease .
17490864	2	342	We investigated the effect of an early stress , in the form of maternal deprivation , combined with a later stress , simulated by chronic periadolescent corticosterone treatment , on behaviour in rats .
17490864	3	540	Acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or corticosterone treatment , but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress .
17490864	4	811	Amphetamine treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non - deprived groups , but was absent in both maternally deprived groups .
17490864	5	941	The serotonin - 1A receptor agonist , 8 - OH - DPAT , induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups .
17490864	6	1042	Amphetamine - induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in all groups .
17490864	7	1113	These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress , caused by maternal deprivation , combined with ' adolescent ' stress , simulated by corticosterone treatment , on dopaminergic regulation of PPI .
17490864	8	1316	The altered effects of apomorphine and amphetamine could indicate differential changes in dopamine receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation , or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus .
17511042	0	0	An extremely rare case of delusional parasitosis in a chronic hepatitis C patient during pegylated interferon alpha - 2b and ribavirin treatment .
17511042	1	144	During treatment of chronic hepatitis C patients with interferon and ribavirin , a lot of side effects are described .
17511042	2	261	Twenty - three percent to 44 % of patients develop depression .
17511042	3	321	A minority of patients evolve to psychosis .
17511042	4	365	To the best of our knowledge , no cases of psychogenic parasitosis occurring during interferon therapy have been described in the literature .
17511042	5	506	We present a 49 - year - old woman who developed a delusional parasitosis during treatment with pegylated interferon alpha - 2b weekly and ribavirin .
17511042	6	650	She complained of seeing parasites and the larvae of fleas in her stools .
17511042	7	724	This could not be confirmed by any technical examination .
17511042	8	782	All the complaints disappeared after stopping pegylated interferon alpha - 2b and reappeared after restarting it .
17511042	9	894	She had a complete sustained viral response .
17574447	0	0	Hepatonecrosis and cholangitis related to long - term phenobarbital therapy : an autopsy report of two patients .
17574447	1	110	Phenobarbital ( PB ) has a reputation for safety , and it is commonly believed that PB - related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease .
17574447	2	326	Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with PB who died suddenly : one as consequence of cardiac arrest , the other of acute bronchopneumonia .
17574447	3	505	At autopsy , analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate , which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells , associated with several foci of necrosis surrounded by a hard ring of non - specific granulomatous tissue .
17574447	4	753	Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen .
17574447	5	839	Our findings illustrate that PB may be associated with chronic liver damage , which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences .
17574447	6	977	For this reason , each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of PB - related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction .
17682013	0	0	Delayed leukoencephalopathy with stroke - like presentation in chemotherapy recipients .
17682013	1	86	BACKGROUND : A transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy , most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leukaemia .
17682013	2	300	Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration .
17682013	3	448	METHODS : We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke - like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy .
17682013	4	630	We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data .
17682013	5	693	Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded .
17682013	6	748	RESULTS : We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate ( intrathecal , systemic ) , 5 - fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur , and capecitabine .
17682013	7	936	Diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI ) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum , corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) maps ( available in 21 / 27 patients ) .
17682013	8	1249	Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories .
17682013	9	1313	Complete resolution of symptoms within 1 - 4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities .
17682013	10	1416	However , fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities .
17682013	11	1538	CONCLUSIONS : Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed .
17682013	12	1691	DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome .
17702969	0	0	Prenatal exposure to fluoxetine induces fetal pulmonary hypertension in the rat .
17702969	1	81	RATIONALE : Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used by pregnant women .
17702969	2	193	Epidemiological data suggest that fluoxetine exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent pulmonary hypertension syndrome of the newborn .
17702969	3	345	The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical , considering the current evidence of a pulmonary hypertension protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents .
17702969	4	523	OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the fluoxetine effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate .
17702969	5	666	METHODS : Pregnant rats were treated with fluoxetine ( 10 mg / kg ) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation .
17702969	6	770	MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section .
17702969	7	845	As compared with controls , fluoxetine exposure resulted in fetal pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum ( P = 0 . 02 ) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
17702969	8	1119	Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals , and arterial oxygen saturation was 96 + / - 1 % in 1 - day - old control animals and significantly lower ( P < 0 . 01 ) in fluoxetine - exposed pups ( 79 + / - 2 % ) .
17702969	9	1330	In vitro , fluoxetine induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal , but not adult , animals ( P < 0 . 01 ) and reduced serotonin - induced contraction at both ages ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
17702969	10	1508	After in utero exposure to a low fluoxetine concentration the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation rate was significantly increased in fetal , but not adult , cells ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
17702969	11	1698	CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to the adult , fluoxetine exposure in utero induces pulmonary hypertension in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation .
17786501	0	0	Disulfiram - induced transient optic and peripheral neuropathy : a case report .
17786501	1	77	AIM : To report a case of optic and peripheral neuropathy after chronic use of disulfiram for alcohol dependence management .
17786501	2	201	MATERIALS AND METHODS : A case report .
17786501	3	239	RESULTS : A 57 - year - old male presented with gradual loss of vision in both eyes with intermittent headaches for 2 months .
17786501	4	360	He also complained of paraesthesia with numbness in both feet .
17786501	5	423	His vision was 6 / 15 and 2 / 60 in the right and left eyes , respectively .
17786501	6	494	Fundoscopy revealed bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads .
17786501	7	553	Visual field testing confirmed bilateral central - caecal scotomata .
17786501	8	620	He had been taking disulfiram for alcohol dependence for the preceding 3 years .
17786501	9	700	Disulfiram discontinuation lead to an immediate symptomatic improvement .
17786501	10	773	CONCLUSION : Physicians initiating long - term disulfiram therapy should be aware of these adverse effects .
17786501	11	878	They should recommend annual ophthalmic reviews with visual field testing .
17786501	12	953	Patients should be reassured with respect to the reversibility of these adverse effects .
17923537	0	0	Intraocular pressure in patients with uveitis treated with fluocinolone acetonide implants .
17923537	1	92	OBJECTIVE : To report the incidence and management of elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in patients with uveitis treated with the fluocinolone acetonide ( FA ) intravitreal implant .
17923537	2	273	DESIGN : Pooled data from 3 multicenter , double - masked , randomized , controlled , phase 2b / 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0 . 59 - mg or 2 . 1 - mg FA intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed .
17923537	3	498	RESULTS : During the 3 - year follow - up , 71 . 0 % of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55 . 1 % , 24 . 7 % , and 6 . 2 % of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more , 40 mm Hg or more , and 50 mm Hg or more , respectively .
17923537	4	739	Topical IOP - lowering medication was administered in 74 . 8 % of implanted eyes , and IOP - lowering surgeries , most of which were trabeculectomies ( 76 . 2 % ) , were performed on 36 . 6 % of implanted eyes .
17923537	5	932	Intraocular pressure - lowering surgeries were considered a success ( postoperative IOP of 6 - 21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP - lowering medication ) in 85 . 1 % of eyes at 1 year .
17923537	6	1111	The rate of hypotony ( IOP < / = 5 mm Hg ) following IOP - lowering surgery ( 42 . 5 % ) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery ( 35 . 4 % ) ( P = . 09 ) .
17923537	7	1279	CONCLUSION : Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the FA intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery .
17943461	0	0	Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to AZT - induced cardiomyopathy .
17943461	1	89	BACKGROUND : Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) and myocarditis occur in many HIV - infected individuals , resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5 % of patients .
17943461	2	250	Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies .
17943461	3	459	METHODS AND RESULTS : In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine ( 3 ' - azido - 2 ' , 3 ' - deoxythymidine ; AZT ) triggers the Fas - dependent cell - death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM , 8 - week - old transgenic ( expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium : FasL Tg ) and non - transgenic ( NTg ) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT ( 0 , 0 . 07 , 0 . 2 , and 0 . 7 mg / ml ) .
17943461	4	889	After 6 weeks , cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods .
17943461	5	1034	NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function .
17943461	6	1126	In contrast , AZT - treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose - dependent manner , with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles .
17943461	7	1313	These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL , as well as increased activation of caspase 3 , translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere , and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis .
17943461	8	1560	These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization , as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity .
17943461	9	1688	CONCLUSIONS : The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium , as identified in HIV - positive patients , might increase the susceptibility to HAART - induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways , resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction .
17965424	0	0	Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients : results of the etoricoxib vs diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial ( EDGE - II ) .
17965424	1	190	OBJECTIVE : A randomised , double - blind study to compare the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerability , safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .
17965424	2	378	PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 4086 patients ( mean age 60 . 8 years ) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily ( n = 2032 ) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily ( n = 2054 ) .
17965424	3	570	Use of gastroprotective agents and low - dose aspirin was allowed .
17965424	4	635	The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences ( AEs ) .
17965424	5	792	General safety was also assessed , including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data .
17965424	6	886	Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status ( PGADS ; 0 - 4 point scale ) .
17965424	7	989	RESULTS : Mean ( SD ; maximum ) duration of treatment was 19 . 3 ( 10 . 3 ; 32 . 9 ) and 19 . 1 ( 10 . 4 ; 33 . 1 ) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups , respectively .
17965424	8	1145	The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac ( 5 . 2 vs 8 . 5 events per 100 patient - years , respectively ; hazard ratio 0 . 62 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 47 , 0 . 81 ; p < or = 0 . 001 ) ) .
17965424	9	1360	The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension - related and oedema - related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib ( 2 . 5 % and 1 . 1 % respectively ) compared with diclofenac ( 1 . 5 % and 0 . 4 % respectively ; p < 0 . 001 for hypertension and p < 0 . 01 for oedema ) .
17965424	10	1616	Etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy ( PGADS mean changes from baseline - 0 . 62 vs - 0 . 58 , respectively ) .
17965424	11	1746	CONCLUSIONS : Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg .
17965424	12	1891	Discontinuations from renovascular AEs , although less common than discontinuations from GI AEs , were significantly higher with etoricoxib .
17975693	0	0	Anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin in rats .
17975693	1	63	INTRODUCTION : The possible anxiogenic effects of fluoroquinolones , namely ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin , were investigated in adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex , weighing 150 - 200 g . METHODS : The drugs were given orally , in doses of 50 mg / kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day .
17975693	2	395	The tests included open - field exploratory behaviour , elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze , social interaction and novelty - suppressed feeding latency behaviour .
17975693	3	560	RESULTS : The results indicate that ciprofloxacin - and norfloxacin - treated rats showed anxious behaviour in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied .
17975693	4	725	However , ciprofloxacin - and norfloxacin - treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameters .
17975693	5	858	CONCLUSION : The present experimental findings substantiate the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin .
18006530	0	0	Reduction of pain during induction with target - controlled propofol and remifentanil .
18006530	1	85	BACKGROUND : Pain on injection of propofol is unpleasant .
18006530	2	142	We hypothesized that propofol infusion pain might be prevented by infusing remifentanil before starting the propofol infusion in a clinical setting where target - controlled infusions ( TCI ) of both drugs were used .
18006530	3	355	A prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was performed to determine the effect - site concentration ( Ce ) of remifentanil to prevent the pain without producing complications .
18006530	4	552	METHODS : A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline ( control ) or remifentanil to a target Ce of 2 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R2 ) , 4 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R4 ) , or 6 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R6 ) administered via TCI .
18006530	5	783	After the target Ce was achieved , the infusion of propofol was started .
18006530	6	855	Remifentanil - related complications were assessed during the remifentanil infusion , and pain caused by propofol was evaluated using a four - point scale during the propofol infusion .
18006530	7	1035	RESULTS : The incidence of pain was significantly lower in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups ( 12 / 32 and 6 / 31 vs 26 / 31 and 25 / 32 , respectively , P < 0 . 001 ) .
18006530	8	1204	Pain was less severe in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
18006530	9	1290	However , both incidence and severity of pain were not different between Groups R4 and R6 .
18006530	10	1380	No significant complications were observed during the study .
18006530	11	1441	CONCLUSIONS : During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of propofol and remifentanil , a significant reduction in propofol infusion pain was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of remifentanil at a target Ce of 4 ng ml ( - 1 ) .
18086064	0	0	Dexmedetomidine and cardiac protection for non - cardiac surgery : a meta - analysis of randomised controlled trials .
18086064	1	113	We conducted a systematic review of the effects of dexmedetomidine on cardiac outcomes following non - cardiac surgery .
18086064	2	231	We included prospective , randomised peri - operative studies of dexmedetomidine that reported mortality , cardiac morbidity or adverse drug events .

18086064	7	871	Peri - operative hypotension ( 26 % , OR 3 . 80 , 95 % CI 1 . 91 - 7 . 54 , p = 0 . 0001 ) and bradycardia ( 17 % , OR 5 . 45 , 95 % CI 2 . 98 - 9 . 95 , p < 0 . 00001 ) were significantly increased .
18086064	8	1035	An anticholinergic did not reduce the incidence of bradycardia ( p = 0 . 43 ) .
18086064	9	1110	A randomised placebo - controlled trial of dexmedetomidine is warranted .
18161408	0	0	Myocardial infarction in pregnancy associated with clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction : a case report .
18161408	1	110	BACKGROUND : Clomiphene citrate ( CC ) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction .
18161408	2	194	It is considered safe , with minimal side effects .
18161408	3	244	Thromboembolism is a rare but life - threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with CC .
18161408	4	362	Spontaneous coronary thrombosis or thromboembolism with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of myocardial infarction ( MI ) during pregnancy , with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram .
18161408	5	587	CASE : A 33 - year - old woman with a 5 - week gestation had recently received CC for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain .
18161408	6	717	An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall myocardial infarction .
18161408	7	796	Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9 . 10 ng / mL .
18161408	8	860	An initial exercise stress test was normal .
18161408	9	904	At the time of admission , the patient was at high risk of radiation injury to the fetus , so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester .
18161408	10	1059	It showed normal coronary vessels .
18161408	11	1094	CONCLUSION : This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between CC and myocardial infarction .
18161408	12	1222	Thrombosis might be a rare but hazardous complication of CC .
18161408	13	1283	Given this life - threatening complication , appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high - risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation .
18177388	0	0	Reverse or inverted left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome ( reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ) in a young woman in the setting of amphetamine use .
18177388	1	151	Transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome was first described in Japan as " Takotsubo cardiomyopathy . "
18177388	2	265	This syndrome has been identified in many other countries .
18177388	3	324	Many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature .
18177388	4	405	One of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome , with hyperdynamic apex and complete akinesia of the base ( as opposed to the classic apical ballooning ) .
18177388	5	565	In this article , we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse apical ballooning syndrome occurring after amphetamine use .
18177388	6	734	This report is followed by review of the literature .

18201582	1	274	OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed - dose combination ( FDC ) of telmisartan 40 mg + amlodipine 5 mg ( T + A ) compared with amlodipine 5 - mg monotherapy ( A ) in adult Indian patients with stage II hypertension .
18201582	2	535	METHODS : This comparative , Phase III , 12 - week , multicenter , prospective , randomized , double - blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II hypertension .
18201582	3	732	Patients were treated with oral FDC of T + A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks ; blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position .
18201582	4	888	Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP ( SBP ) / diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline to study end and number of responders ( ie , patients who achieved target SBP / DBP < 130 / < 80 mm Hg ) at end of study .
18201582	5	1109	Tolerability was assessed by treatment - emergent adverse events , identified using physical examination , laboratory analysis , and electrocardiography .
18201582	6	1258	RESULTS : A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study ; 203 patients ( 143 men , 60 women ) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow - up ( 4 patients in the T + A group and 3 in the A group ) and considered with - drawn .
18201582	7	1481	At study end , statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP ( T + A [ - 27 . 4 % ] ; A [ - 16 . 6 % ] ) and DBP ( T + A [ - 20 . 1 % ] ; A [ - 13 . 3 % ] ) ( all , P < 0 . 05 ) .
18201582	8	1690	Response rates were 87 . 3 % ( 89 / 102 ) in the T + A group and 69 . 3 % ( 70 / 101 ) in the A group ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
18201582	9	1788	The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups ( T + A , 16 . 0 % [ 17 / 106 ] ; A , 15 . 4 % [ 16 / 104 ] ) .
18201582	10	1928	Peripheral edema was reported in 8 . 5 % patients ( 9 / 106 ) in the T + A group compared with 13 . 5 % ( 14 / 104 ) in the A group , and cough was reported in 3 . 8 % patients ( 4 / 106 ) in the T + A group and 1 . 0 % ( 1 / 104 ) patients in the A group ; these differences did not reach statistical significance .
18201582	11	2210	The incidences of headache , dizziness , and diarrhea were similar between the 2 groups .
18201582	12	2297	CONCLUSIONS : Among these Indian patients with stage II hypertension , the FDC of T + A was found to be significantly more effective , with regard to BP reductions , than A , and both treatments were well tolerated .
18239197	0	0	Increased mental slowing associated with the APOE epsilon4 allele after trihexyphenidyl oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly .
18239197	1	139	OBJECTIVES : The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon4 and subjective effects of trihexyphenidyl on measures reflecting sedation and confusion and to investigate the relationship between trihexyphenidyl - induced subjective effects and objective memory performance .
18239197	2	444	METHODS : This study comprised 24 cognitively intact , health elderly adults ( 12 APOE epsilon4 carriers ) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic .
18239197	3	602	This was a randomized , double blind , placebo - controlled , three - way , crossover experimental design .
18239197	4	701	All participants received 1 . 0 mg or 2 . 0 mg trihexyphenidyl or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks .
18239197	5	855	Bond and Lader ' s visual analog scales and alternate versions of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline , 1 , 2 . 5 , and 5 hours postdrug administration .
18239197	6	1062	RESULTS : A 2 . 0 - mg oral dose of trihexyphenidyl resulted in increased subjective ratings of mental slowness in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only .
18239197	7	1215	Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2 . 0 mg trihexyphenidyl and placebo on ratings of mental slowness significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only .
18239197	8	1477	However , no significant effects were found with other visual analog scales reflecting subjective sedation and clear - headedness .

18356633	0	0	An evaluation of amikacin nephrotoxicity in the hematology / oncology population .
18356633	1	80	Amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empirical double gram - negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infections .
18356633	2	232	Strategies of extended - interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population ; however , data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology / oncology population .
18356633	3	448	To evaluate amikacin - associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology / oncology population , a prospective , randomized , open - label trial was conducted at a university - affiliated medical center .
18356633	4	640	Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic / oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended - interval amikacin .
18356633	5	838	The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed .
18356633	6	1017	The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended - interval groups , at 10 % and 5 % , respectively ( P = 1 . 00 ) .
18356633	7	1157	Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture , compared with none in the extended - interval group ( P = 0 . 002 ) .
18356633	8	1283	The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens , but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups .
18356633	9	1435	Efficacy could not be assessed .
18363626	0	0	High dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI .
18363626	1	66	OBJECTIVE : This large - scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of dexmedetomidine .
18363626	2	166	AIM : To determine the hemodynamic responses , efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) studies .
18363626	3	359	BACKGROUND : Dexmedetomidine has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies .
18363626	4	495	Over time , an effective protocol utilizing high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative agent has evolved .
18363626	5	604	METHODS / MATERIALS : As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process , data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed .
18363626	6	750	Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received dexmedetomidine for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007 .
18363626	7	880	RESULTS : Since 2005 , the 10 - min loading dose of our dexmedetomidine protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg . kg ( - 1 ) , and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1 . 5 to 2 microg . kg ( - 1 ) . h ( - 1 ) .
18363626	8	1066	The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation ( able to complete the imaging study ) when using dexmedetomidine alone from 91 . 8 % to 97 . 6 % ( P = 0 . 009 ) , reducing the requirement for adjuvant pentobarbital in the event of sedation failure with dexmedetomidine alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
18363626	9	1427	Although dexmedetomidine sedation was associated with a 16 % incidence of bradycardia , all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20 % of age - adjusted normal range and oxygen saturations were 95 % or higher .
18363626	10	1647	CONCLUSION : Dexmedetomidine in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric MRI studies .
18363626	11	1743	While use of high dose dexmedetomidine is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established ' awake ' norms , this deviation is generally within 20 % of norms , and is not associated with adverse sequelae .
18363626	12	1977	Dexmedetomidine is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI .
18405372	0	0	Hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine in inflammatory arthritis : A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events .
18405372	1	139	BACKGROUND : Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) are handicapped by under - reporting and limited detail on individual cases .
18405372	2	290	We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti - rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure in two of our patients .
18405372	3	511	METHODS : Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years .
18405372	4	630	Patients ' , who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR , were identified .
18405372	5	737	Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument .
18405372	6	869	The likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions .
18405372	7	989	RESULTS : Ten cases were identified : eight occurred during surveillance .
18405372	8	1061	Eight patients were hospitalised , two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transplant .
18405372	9	1155	All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment .
18405372	10	1211	Seven patients had a skin rash , three eosinophilia and one interstitial nephritis .
18405372	11	1294	Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent .
18405372	12	1363	Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six .
18405372	13	1451	Drug - related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients .
18405372	14	1533	The likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0 . 4 % of treated patients .
18405372	15	1642	CONCLUSION : Serious hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine appears to be under - appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important .
18441470	0	0	Complete atrioventricular block secondary to lithium therapy .
18441470	1	62	Sinus node dysfunction has been reported most frequently among the adverse cardiovascular effects of lithium .
18441470	2	172	In the present case , complete atrioventricular ( AV ) block with syncopal attacks developed secondary to lithium therapy , necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation .
18441470	3	340	Serum lithium levels remained under or within the therapeutic range during the syncopal attacks .
18441470	4	437	Lithium should be used with extreme caution , especially in patients with mild disturbance of AV conduction .
18483878	0	0	Exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout ( VIP - / - ) mice with cyclophosphamide ( CYP ) - induced cystitis .
18483878	1	155	Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways .
18483878	2	268	VIP ( - / - ) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after cyclophosphamide ( CYP ) - induced cystitis .
18483878	3	415	Given VIP ' s role as an anti - inflammatory mediator , we hypothesized that VIP ( - / - ) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cystitis .
18483878	4	573	A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type ( WT ) and VIP ( - / - ) mice with or without CYP - induced cystitis ( 150 mg / kg ; i . p . ; 48 h ) .
18483878	5	800	Four binary comparisons were made : WT control versus CYP treatment ( 48 h ) , VIP ( - / - ) control versus CYP treatment ( 48 h ) , WT control versus VIP ( - / - ) control , and WT with CYP treatment ( 48 h ) versus VIP ( - / - ) with CYP treatment ( 48 h ) .
18483878	6	1033	The genes presented represent ( 1 ) greater than 1 . 5 - fold change in either direction and ( 2 ) the p value is less than 0 . 05 for the comparison being made .
18483878	7	1185	Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme - linked immunoassays including IL - 1beta and CXCL1 .
18483878	8	1287	CYP treatment significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) increased expression of CXCL1 and IL - 1beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP ( - / - ) mice , but expression in VIP ( - / - ) mice with CYP treatment was significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) greater ( 4 . 2 - to 13 - fold increase ) than that observed in WT urinary bladder ( 3 . 6 - to 5 - fold increase ) .
18483878	9	1612	The data suggest that in VIP ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation , inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with CYP .
18483878	10	1751	This shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in VIP ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways .
1848636	0	0	Debrisoquine phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta - 2 receptor pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its enantiomers .
1848636	1	120	The metabolism of the cardioselective beta - blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine / sparteine type .
1848636	2	243	The two metabolic phenotypes , extensive ( EM ) and poor metabolizers ( PM ) , show different stereoselective metabolism , resulting in apparently higher beta - 1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EMs .
1848636	3	461	We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta - 2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol .
1848636	4	557	The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline - induced hypokalemia .
1848636	5	650	By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S - isomer , were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values , representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half - maximum receptor occupancy .
1848636	6	917	Six EMs received 0 . 5 mg of terbutaline s . c . on two different occasions : 1 ) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2 ) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p . o . Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol , except for a higher terbutaline dose ( 0 . 75 mg ) on day 2 .
1848636	7	1186	Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium , terbutaline , metoprolol ( racemic , R - and S - isomer ) , and alpha - hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals , during 8 hr after metoprolol .
1848636	8	1401	In PMs , metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs . time curve ( + 67 % ) .
1848636	9	1505	Higher metoprolol / alpha - hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R - / S - isomer ratios of unchanged drug .
1848636	10	1626	There was a difference in metoprolol potency with higher racemic metoprolol IC50 values in PMs ( 72 + / - 7 ng . ml - 1 ) than EMs ( 42 + / - 8 ng . ml - 1 , P less than . 001 ) . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
18513945	0	0	The hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery : findings in six cases .
18513945	1	131	Oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension , particularly when given as a bolus .
18513945	2	261	The resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return .
18513945	3	404	Parturients with normal volume status , heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume .
18513945	4	583	Oxytocin - induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss .
18513945	5	678	Pulse power analysis ( also called " pulse contour analysis " ) of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time , thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure .
18513945	6	942	Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia .
18513945	7	1049	Hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume , heart rate and cardiac output .
18513945	8	1225	Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating hypotension during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia .
18541230	0	0	Protective effects of antithrombin on puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats .
18541230	1	83	We investigated the effects of antithrombin , a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors , in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrosis , which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syndrome .
18541230	2	289	Antithrombin ( 50 or 500 IU / kg / i . v . ) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside ( 50 mg / kg / i . v . ) .
18541230	3	451	Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside - induced hematological abnormalities .
18541230	4	557	Puromycin aminonucleoside - induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed .
18541230	5	650	Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats , while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin - treated rats .
18541230	6	874	In addition , antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside - induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells .
18541230	7	1009	Furthermore , puromycin aminonucleoside - induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased .
18541230	8	1113	These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome .
18541230	9	1251	Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome .
18589141	0	0	Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation .
18589141	1	62	BACKGROUND : Unfractionated heparin sodium ( UFH ) or low - molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation .
18589141	2	259	Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) is an adverse immune - mediated reaction to heparin , resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50 % .
18589141	3	405	The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4 / heparin - reactive antibody ( HIT antibody ) positivity in liver transplantation patients , however , are unknown .
18589141	4	587	PATIENTS AND METHODS : The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation .
18589141	5	679	We started LMWH ( 25 IU / kg / h ) on postoperative day ( POD ) 1 , switching to UFH ( 5000 U / d ) on POD 2 or 3 .
18589141	6	781	The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level .
18589141	7	857	HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14 .
18589141	8	935	Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks .
18589141	9	982	RESULTS : The average platelet counts preoperatively , and on POD 7 , 14 , and 21 were 65 , 88 , 149 , and 169 x 10 ( 9 ) / L , respectively .
18589141	10	1111	Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19 , respectively , although they were HIT antibody - negative and their platelet counts were stable .
18589141	11	1272	In 2 other patients , the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 4 to 65 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 7 to 33 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 9 , respectively .
18589141	12	1455	The heparin - induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients .
18589141	13	1533	The percentage of HIT antibody - positive patients was 0 . 5 % preoperatively , 5 . 6 % on POD 7 , and 5 . 6 % on POD 14 .
18589141	14	1642	None of the subjects / patients developed UFH - related HIT .
18589141	15	1699	CONCLUSIONS : In our series , the occurrence of HIT after liver transplantation was uncommon .
18627295	0	0	Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy - induced inflammation and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B1 receptor .
18627295	1	120	Clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin ( DOX ) is limited by its cardiotoxic effects , which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis .
18627295	2	263	To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor ( B1R ) during the development of DOX cardiomyopathy , we studied B1R knockout mice ( B1R ( - / - ) ) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of DOX - induced cardiomyopathy .
18627295	3	510	DOX control mice showed cardiac dysfunction measured by pressure - volume loops in vivo .
18627295	4	597	This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT , as well as an increased bax / bcl2 ratio in Western blots , indicating cardiac apoptosis .
18627295	5	744	Furthermore , mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue .
18627295	6	853	In DOX B1R ( - / - ) mice , cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice , which was associated with normalization of the bax / bcl - 2 ratio and interleukin 6 , as well as AKT activation state .
18627295	7	1053	These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in DOX cardiomyopathy in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis .
18627295	8	1183	These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B1R antagonists for treatment of human DOX cardiomyopathy .
18657397	0	0	Detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin - induced epileptiform activity in anesthetized rats .
18657397	1	101	Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research .
18657397	2	177	In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin - induced epileptiform activity in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats .
18657397	3	360	Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i . p . urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup .
18657397	4	460	After a short period of basal activity recording , epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400IU / 2 microl penicillin - G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded .
18657397	5	676	Basal activity , latent period and the penicillin - induced epileptiform activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis .
18657397	6	837	Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta , theta ( slow and fast ) , alpha - sigma , beta ( 1 and 2 ) and gamma ( 1 and 2 ) bands .
18657397	7	1027	Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta , theta , beta - 2 and gamma - 2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes ( basal activity , latent period and epileptiform activity ) .
18657397	8	1320	Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental epilepsies .
18674790	0	0	High fat diet - fed obese rats are highly sensitive to doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity .
18674790	1	89	Often , chemotherapy by doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy .
18674790	2	223	Recently , we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity .
18674790	3	342	This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty - acid oxidation , ATP synthesis , and upregulated JAK / STAT3 pathway .
18674790	4	529	In the current study , we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40 % high fat diet ( HFD ) , which induces obesity in male Sprague - Dawley rats ( 250 - 275 g ) , sensitizes to doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity .
18674790	5	753	A LD ( 10 ) dose ( 8 mg doxorubicin / kg , ip ) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity , cardiac dysfunction , lipid peroxidation , and 80 % mortality in the obese ( OB ) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity .
18674790	6	1016	Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol ( toxic metabolite ) in the normal diet - fed ( ND ) and OB hearts .
18674790	7	1181	Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to : ( 1 ) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 , ( 2 ) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor - alpha , ( 3 ) decreased plasma adiponectin levels , ( 4 ) decreased cardiac fatty - acid oxidation ( 666 . 9 + / - 14 . 0 nmol / min / g heart in ND versus 400 . 2 + / - 11 . 8 nmol / min / g heart in OB ) , ( 5 ) decreased mitochondrial AMP - alpha2 protein kinase , and ( 6 ) 86 % drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP / ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration .
18674790	8	1745	Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK / STAT3 pathway .
18674790	9	1860	In conclusion , HFD - induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation , increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK / STAT3 pathway .
18808529	0	0	Isoproterenol induces primary loss of dystrophin in rat hearts : correlation with myocardial injury .
18808529	1	100	The mechanism of isoproterenol - induced myocardial damage is unknown , but a mismatch of oxygen supply vs . demand following coronary hypotension and myocardial hyperactivity is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed .
18808529	2	348	Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by isoproterenol .
18808529	3	485	Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin - glycoprotein complex ( DGC ) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins , this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins .
18808529	4	818	We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to isoproterenol subcutaneous administration .
18808529	5	919	Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix .
18808529	6	1099	The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin .
18808529	7	1184	Subsequently , after lysis of myofilaments , gamma - sarcoglycan , beta - dystroglycan , beta1 - integrin , and laminin alpha - 2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown , as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process .
18808529	8	1400	In conclusion , administration of isoproterenol to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin , the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte .
18808529	9	1639	These changes , related to ischaemic injury , explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by isoproterenol .
188339	0	0	Etiologic factors in the pathogenesis of liver tumors associated with oral contraceptives .
188339	1	91	Within the last several years , previously rare liver tumors have been seen in young women using oral contraceptive steroids .
188339	2	216	The Registry for Liver Tumors Associated with Oral Contraceptives at the University of California , Irvine , has clearly identified 27 cases .
188339	3	356	The recent literature contains 44 case reports .
188339	4	404	Common to these 71 cases has been a histopathologic diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia , adenoma , hamartoma , and hepatoma .
188339	5	530	Significant statistical etiologic factors include prolonged uninterrupted usage of oral contraceptive steroids .
188339	6	642	Eight deaths and liver rupture in 18 patients attest to the seriousness of this new potentially lethal adverse phenomenon .
1899352	0	0	Ifosfamide continuous infusion without mesna .
1899352	1	46	A phase I trial of a 14 - day cycle .
1899352	2	81	Twenty patients received 27 courses of ifosfamide administered as a 24 - hour continuous infusion for 14 days without Mesna .
1899352	3	204	The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short - term infusions administered with Mesna .
1899352	4	385	Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300 , 400 , 450 , 500 , and 550 mg / m2 / d .
1899352	5	461	Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400 , 450 , and 500 mg / m2 / d .
1899352	6	547	There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria .
1899352	7	597	At 550 mg / m2 / d , three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity ; confusion ( 1 ) , nausea ( 1 ) , and Grade 2 leukopenia ( 1 ) .
1899352	8	717	The recommended dose of 500 mg / m2 / d delivers a total dose of 7 g / m2 per cycle , which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short - term infusion .
1899352	9	889	Because few patients received multiple courses over time , the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial .
1899352	10	1010	The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise , and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential , adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria .
1899352	11	1203	The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to 890 per cycle .
1899352	12	1393	Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient , but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained .
18997632	0	0	A case of ventricular tachycardia related to caffeine pretreatment .
18997632	1	68	Suboptimal seizure duration is commonly encountered in electroconvulsive therapy practice , especially in older patients with higher seizure thresholds .
18997632	2	220	Intravenous caffeine is commonly used to improve seizure duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign ventricular ectopy .
18997632	3	418	We describe a patient with no previous history of cardiac disease or arrhythmia who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of ventricular tachycardia after caffeine administration .
18997632	4	606	Although intravenous caffeine is generally well tolerated , the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious ventricular arrhythmias .
19058474	0	0	Fatal haemopericardium and gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to possible interaction of cranberry juice with warfarin .
19058474	1	118	We report a case of fatal internal haemorrhage in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of warfarin .
19058474	2	279	We propose that naturally occurring compounds such as flavonoids , which are present in fruit juices , may increase the potency of warfarin by competing for the enzymes that normally inactivate warfarin .
19058474	3	481	While traditionally regarded as foodstuffs , consumption of fruit juices should be considered when patients develop adverse drug reactions .
19105845	0	0	Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on bupropion hydrochloride - induced seizures in mice .
19105845	1	105	BACKGROUND : It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of bupropion - induced seizures .
19105845	2	224	This is important , since different controlled release formulations of bupropion release the active drug at different rates .
19105845	3	348	METHODS : We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg , a known convulsive dose 50 ( CD50 ) , on the incidence and severity of bupropion - induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice .
19105845	4	582	A total of 69 mice , approximately 7 weeks of age , and weighing 21 . 0 to 29 . 1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg treatment by intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration in 7 groups ( 9 to 10 animals per group ) .
19105845	5	800	Bupropion HCl was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min , 15 min , 30 min , 60 min , 90 min , 120 min , and 240 min .
19105845	6	969	The number , time of onset , duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded .
19105845	7	1083	RESULTS : The results showed that IP administration of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice ( 60 % of convulsing mice ) in group 1 .
19105845	8	1257	Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant ( p = 0 . 0004 ; odds ratio = 0 . 974 ) and increasing the IP infusion time of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg was associated with a 91 % reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection .
19105845	9	1543	Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99 . 8 % reduction at 240 min .
19105845	10	1665	CONCLUSION : In conclusion , the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is novel .
19135948	0	0	Graft - versus - host disease prophylaxis with everolimus and tacrolimus is associated with a high incidence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and microangiopathy : results of the EVTAC trial .
19135948	1	189	A calcineurin inhibitor combined with methotrexate is the standard prophylaxis for graft - versus - host disease ( GVHD ) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) .
19135948	2	370	Everolimus , a derivative of sirolimus , seems to mediate antileukemia effects .
19135948	3	448	We report on a combination of everolimus and tacrolimus in 24 patients ( median age , 62 years ) with either myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ; n = 17 ) or acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ; n = 7 ) undergoing intensive conditioning followed by HSCT from related ( n = 4 ) or unrelated ( n = 20 ) donors .
19135948	4	734	All patients engrafted , and only 1 patient experienced grade IV mucositis .
19135948	5	809	Nine patients ( 37 % ) developed acute grade II - IV GVHD , and 11 of 17 evaluable patients ( 64 % ) developed chronic extensive GVHD .
19135948	6	935	Transplantation - associated microangiopathy ( TMA ) occurred in 7 patients ( 29 % ) , with 2 cases of acute renal failure .
19135948	7	1051	The study was terminated prematurely because an additional 6 patients ( 25 % ) developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome ( SOS ) , which was fatal in 2 cases .
19135948	8	1204	With a median follow - up of 26 months , the 2 - year overall survival rate was 47 % .
19135948	9	1284	Although this new combination appears to be effective as a prophylactic regimen for acute GVHD , the incidence of TMA and SOS is considerably higher than seen with other regimens .
19139001	0	0	Longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase III clinical trial of difluoromethylornithine and sulindac for prevention of sporadic colorectal adenomas .
19139001	1	171	A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of adenomatous polyps after treatment for 36 months with difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO ) plus sulindac or matched placebos .
19139001	2	345	Temporary hearing loss is a known toxicity of treatment with DFMO , thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms .
19139001	3	501	The generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within - subject correlation due to repeated measurements at frequencies .
19139001	4	751	Based on 290 subjects , there was an average difference of 0 . 50 dB between subjects treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo ( 95 % confidence interval , - 0 . 64 to 1 . 63 dB ; P = 0 . 39 ) , adjusted for baseline values , age , and frequencies .
19139001	5	1014	In the normal speech range of 500 to 3 , 000 Hz , an estimated difference of 0 . 99 dB ( - 0 . 17 to 2 . 14 dB ; P = 0 . 09 ) was detected .
19139001	6	1139	Dose intensity did not add information to models .
19139001	7	1189	There were 14 of 151 ( 9 . 3 % ) in the DFMO plus sulindac group and 4 of 139 ( 2 . 9 % ) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested ( P = 0 . 02 ) .
19139001	8	1433	Follow - up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1 . 08 dB ( - 0 . 81 to 2 . 96 dB ; P = 0 . 26 ) between treatment arms .
19139001	9	1625	There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the DFMO plus sulindac group who experienced clinically significant hearing loss compared with the placebo group .
19139001	10	1808	The estimated attributable risk of ototoxicity from exposure to the drug is 8 . 4 % ( 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 0 % to 18 . 8 % ; P = 0 . 12 ) .
19139001	11	1942	There is a < 2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo .
19203554	0	0	Proteinase 3 - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody - ( PR3 - ANCA ) positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis after restarting sulphasalazine treatment .
19203554	1	143	A 59 - year - old woman with ulcerative colitis developed red eyes , pleural effusion , eosinophilia and urinary abnormalities after restarting of sulphasalazine treatment .
19203554	2	310	Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement .
19203554	3	448	Proteinase 3 - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( PR3 - ANCA ) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA units ( EU ) in sera ( normal range less than 10 EU ) , myeloperoxidase - ANCA was negative .
19203554	4	626	PR3 - ANCA titer was 250 and 1 , 070 EU in pleural effusions on right and left side , respectively .
19203554	5	721	Although cessation of sulphasalazine treatment resulted in improvements in fever , red eyes , chest pain , titer of C - reactive protein and volume of the pleural effusions , we initiated steroid therapy , because PR3 - ANCA titer rose to 320 EU , eosinophil count increased to 1 , 100 cells / microl , and the pleural effusion remained .
19203554	6	1044	One month after steroid therapy , the pleural effusion disappeared , and PR3 - ANCA titer normalized 3 months later .
19203554	7	1157	This case suggests that sulphasalazine can induce PR3 - ANCA - positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis .
19234905	0	0	Comparison of unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy findings in advanced idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease .
19234905	1	109	A prospective , randomized , double - blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) refractory to medical treatment was designed .
19234905	2	336	Ten consecutive patients ( mean age , 58 . 4 + / - 6 . 8 years ; 7 men , 3 women ) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease ( mean disease time , 8 . 4 + / - 3 . 5 years ) , disabling motor fluctuations ( Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3 - 5 in off - drug phases ) and levodopa - induced dyskinesias were selected .
19234905	3	625	All patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dosing were analysed .
19234905	4	713	Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna ( GPi ) and four in the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) .
19234905	5	823	Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified Parkinson ' s Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , Hoehn _ Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living ( ADL ) score in ' on ' - and ' off ' - drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery .
19234905	6	1070	There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months .
19234905	7	1209	Levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group .
19234905	8	1286	Changes in UPDRS , Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups .
19234905	9	1376	Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups .
19234905	10	1427	Complications were observed in two patients : one had a left homonymous hemianopsia after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with Valproate 1000 mg / day .
19234905	11	1676	The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced PD refractory to medical treatment .
19274460	0	0	DSMM XI study : dose definition for intravenous cyclophosphamide in combination with bortezomib / dexamethasone for remission induction in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma .
19274460	1	175	A clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the recommended dose of cyclophosphamide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone as induction treatment before stem cell transplantation for younger patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ( MM ) .
19274460	2	429	Thirty patients were treated with three 21 - day cycles of bortezomib 1 . 3 mg / m ( 2 ) on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 plus dexamethasone 40 mg on the day of bortezomib injection and the day after plus cyclophosphamide at 900 , 1 , 200 , or 1 , 500 mg / m ( 2 ) on day 1 .
19274460	3	675	The maximum tolerated dose of cyclophosphamide was defined as 900 mg / m ( 2 ) .
19274460	4	750	At this dose level , 92 % of patients achieved at least a partial response .
19274460	5	824	The overall response rate [ complete response ( CR ) plus partial response ( PR ) ] across all dose levels was 77 % , with a 10 % CR rate .
19274460	6	954	No patient experienced progressive disease .
19274460	7	998	The most frequent adverse events were hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities as well as neuropathy .
19274460	8	1105	The results suggest that bortezomib in combination with cyclophosphamide at 900 mg / m ( 2 ) and dexamethasone is an effective induction treatment for patients with newly diagnosed MM that warrants further investigation .
1928887	0	0	Naloxone reversal of hypotension due to captopril overdose .
1928887	1	60	The hemodynamic effects of captopril and other angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors may be mediated by the endogenous opioid system .
1928887	2	197	The opioid antagonist naloxone has been shown to block or reverse the hypotensive actions of captopril .
1928887	3	301	We report a case of an intentional captopril overdose , manifested by marked hypotension , that resolved promptly with the administration of naloxone .
1928887	4	450	To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of captopril - induced hypotension treated with naloxone .
1928887	5	556	Our experience demonstrates a possible role of naloxone in the reversal of hypotension resulting from captopril .
19289093	0	0	Identification of a simple and sensitive microplate method for the detection of oversulfated chondroitin sulfate in heparin products .
19289093	1	134	Heparin is a commonly implemented anticoagulant used to treat critically ill patients .
19289093	2	221	Recently , a number of commercial lots of heparin products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated chondroitin sulfate ( OSCS ) derivative that could elicit a hypotensive response in pigs following a single high - dose infusion .
19289093	3	456	Using both contaminated heparin products and the synthetically produced derivative , we showed that the OSCS produces dose - dependent hypotension in pigs .
19289093	4	609	The no observed effect level ( NOEL ) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1mg / kg , corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3 % .
19289093	5	762	We also demonstrated that OSCS can be identified in heparin products using a simple , inexpensive , commercially available heparin enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) kit that has a limit of detection of approximately 0 . 1 % , well below the NOEL .
19289093	6	994	This kit may provide a useful method to test heparin products for contamination with oversulfated GAG derivatives .
19300240	0	0	5 flourouracil - induced apical ballooning syndrome : a case report .
19300240	1	66	The apical ballooning syndrome ( ABS ) is a recently described stress - mediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient wall - motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular ( LV ) segments without obstructive epicardial coronary disease .
19300240	2	366	Cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents .
19300240	3	443	However , there are no reports of ABS secondary to chemotherapeutic agents .
19300240	4	518	We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer .
19300240	5	619	A 79 - year - old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain , elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST - segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram .
19300240	6	776	She underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer .
19300240	7	862	Echocardiography revealed a wall - motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared akinetic .
19300240	8	984	Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions .
19300240	9	1047	The patient was stabilized with medical therapy .
19300240	10	1096	Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic .
19300240	11	1151	Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical akinesis .
19300240	12	1243	Pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiac complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy include coronary vasospasm , endothelial damage and consequent thrombus formation .
19300240	13	1417	In our patient , both supraphysiologic levels of plasma catecholamines and stress related neuropeptides caused by cancer diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of ABS .
19319147	0	0	Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin - associated intracerebral hemorrhage .
19319147	1	126	Warfarin - associated intracerebral hemorrhage ( W - ICH ) is a severe type of stroke .
19319147	2	207	There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W - ICH .
19319147	3	265	Using a mouse model , we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume .
19319147	4	429	Male CD - 1 mice were treated with warfarin ( 2 mg / kg over 24 h ) , resulting in a mean ( + / - s . d . ) International Normalized Ratio of 3 . 5 + / - 0 . 9 .
19319147	5	567	First , we showed that an intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice .
19319147	6	674	Second , a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum .
19319147	7	783	Forty - five minutes later , the animals were randomly treated with PCC ( 100 U / kg ) or saline i . v . ( n = 12 per group ) .
19319147	8	896	Twenty - four hours after hemorrhage induction , hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay .
19319147	9	1020	The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC - treated animals ( 6 . 5 + / - 3 . 1 microL ) compared with saline controls ( 15 . 3 + / - 11 . 2 microL , P = 0 . 015 ) .
19319147	10	1169	In the saline group , 45 % of the mice developed large hematomas ( i . e . , > 15 microL ) .
19319147	11	1252	In contrast , such extensive lesions were never found in the PCC group .
19319147	12	1323	We provide experimental data suggesting PCC to be an effective acute treatment for W - ICH in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume .
19319147	13	1459	Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W - ICH .
19370593	0	0	Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .
19370593	1	71	BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women .
19370593	2	281	This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005 .
19370593	3	365	OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , cardiovascular outcomes , cancer , gallbladder disease , cognition , fractures and quality of life .
19370593	4	524	SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases to November 2007 : Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .
19370593	5	758	Also relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts .
19370593	6	819	SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .
19370593	7	963	HT included oestrogens , with or without progestogens , via oral , transdermal , subcutaneous or transnasal routes .
19370593	8	1075	DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data .
19370593	9	1174	MAIN RESULTS : Nineteen trials involving 41 , 904 women were included .
19370593	10	1242	In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism or coronary event ( after one year ' s use ) , stroke ( after three years ) , breast cancer and gallbladder disease .
19370593	11	1463	Long - term oestrogen - only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism , stroke and gallbladder disease ( after one to two years , three years and seven years ' use respectively ) , but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer .
19370593	12	1718	The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and ( for combined HT ) colon cancer , with long - term use .
19370593	13	1864	Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy ( i . e . generally fit , without overt disease ) and taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .
19370593	14	2073	Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism .
19370593	15	2214	One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .
19370593	16	2396	The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo - embolism in women taking combined continuous HT : their absolute risk remained low , at less than 1 / 500 .
19370593	17	2569	However , this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women .
19370593	18	2660	AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .
19370593	19	2749	We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .
19642243	0	0	Acute renal failure in patients with AIDS on tenofovir while receiving prolonged vancomycin course for osteomyelitis .
19642243	1	118	Renal failure developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in 2 patients who were receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of an antiretroviral regimen .
19642243	2	290	Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule .
19642243	3	436	Vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic agent .
19642243	4	539	Clinicians should be aware that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure during prolonged administration of vancomycin .
19674115	0	0	Recurrent dysosmia induced by pyrazinamide .
19674115	1	44	Pyrazinamide can have adverse effects such as hepatic toxicity , hyperuricemia or digestive disorders .
19674115	2	146	In rare cases , alterations in taste and smell function have been reported for pyrazinamide when combined with other drugs .
19674115	3	269	We report a case of reversible olfactory disorder related to pyrazinamide in a woman , with a positive rechallenge .
19674115	4	384	The patient presented every day a sensation of smelling something burning 15 min after drug intake .
19674115	5	484	Dysosmia disappeared completely after pyrazinamide withdrawal and recurred after its rechallenge .
19674115	6	582	The case was reported to the Tunisian Centre of Pharmacovigilance .
19692487	0	0	Mice lacking mPGES - 1 are resistant to lithium - induced polyuria .
19692487	1	64	Cyclooxygenase - 2 activity is required for the development of lithium - induced polyuria .
19692487	2	151	However , the involvement of a specific , terminal prostaglandin ( PG ) isomerase has not been evaluated .
19692487	3	253	The present study was undertaken to assess lithium - induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase - 1 ( mPGES - 1 ) .
19692487	4	391	A 2 - wk administration of LiCl ( 4 mmol . kg ( - 1 ) . day ( - 1 ) ip ) in mPGES - 1 + / + mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine .
19692487	5	516	This was associated with elevated renal mPGES - 1 protein expression and increased urine PGE ( 2 ) excretion .
19692487	6	621	In contrast , mPGES - 1 - / - mice were largely resistant to lithium - induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect , accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE ( 2 ) and cAMP output .
19692487	7	814	Immunoblotting , immunohistochemistry , and quantitative ( q ) RT - PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin - 2 ( AQP2 ) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium - treated + / + mice .
19692487	8	1032	This decrease was significantly attenuated in the - / - mice .
19692487	9	1092	qRT - PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex .
19692487	10	1188	Similarly , the total protein abundance of the Na - K - 2Cl cotransporter ( NKCC2 ) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the + / + mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment .
19692487	11	1366	In contrast , the dowregulation of renal medullary NKCC2 expression was significantly attenuated in the - / - mice .
19692487	12	1479	We conclude that mPGES - 1 - derived PGE ( 2 ) mediates lithium - induced polyuria likely via inhibition of AQP2 and NKCC2 expression .
1969772	0	0	Preservation of renal blood flow during hypotension induced with fenoldopam in dogs .
1969772	1	85	The introduction of drugs that could induce hypotension with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy .
1969772	2	302	Specific dopamine - 1 , ( DA1 ) and dopamine - 2 ( DA2 ) receptor agonists are now under clinical investigation .
1969772	3	406	Fenoldopam mesylate is a specific DA1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation .
1969772	4	507	The hypothesis that fenoldopam could be used to induce hypotension and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested .
1969772	5	624	Systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively , in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of fenoldopam and sodium nitroprusside in ten dogs under halothane general anaesthesia .
1969772	6	938	Mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 + / - 8 per cent from control with infusion of fenoldopam ( 3 . 4 + / - 2 . 0 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) and 34 + / - 4 per cent with infusion of sodium nitroprusside ( 5 . 9 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) ( NS ) .
1969772	7	1164	Renal blood flow ( RBF ) increased during fenoldopam - induced hypotension 11 + / - 7 per cent and decreased 21 + / - 8 per cent during sodium nitroprusside - induced hypotension ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .
1969772	8	1353	Sodium nitroprusside is a non - selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced hypotension .
1969772	9	1522	Fenoldopam is a selective dopamine - 1 ( DA1 ) receptor agonist that causes vasodilatation to the kidney and other organs with DA1 receptors and preserves blood flow to the kidney during induced hypotension .
19707748	0	0	Seizures associated with levofloxacin : case presentation and literature review .
19707748	1	80	PURPOSE : We present a case of a patient who developed seizures shortly after initiating treatment with levofloxacin and to discuss the potential drug - drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 1A2 in this case , as well as in other cases , of levofloxacin - induced seizures .
19707748	2	378	METHODS : Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE , Cochrane and Ovid .
19707748	3	468	The main search terms utilized were case report and levofloxacin .
19707748	4	534	The search was limited to studies published in English .
19707748	5	590	RESULTS : Six cases of levofloxacin - induced seizures have been reported in the literature .
19707748	6	680	Drug - drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP1A2 by levofloxacin are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases .
19707748	7	815	CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians are exhorted to pay close attention when initiating levofloxacin therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP1A2 substrates .
19719056	0	0	Dextran - etodolac conjugates : synthesis , in vitro and in vivo evaluation .
19719056	1	73	Etodolac ( E ) , is a non - narcotic analgesic and antiinflammatory drug .
19719056	2	142	A biodegradable polymer dextran has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of etodolac - dextran conjugates ( ED ) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects .
19719056	3	331	An activated moiety , i . e . N - acylimidazole derivative of etodolac ( EAI ) , was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer dextran of different molecular weights ( 40000 , 60000 , 110000 and 200000 ) .
19719056	4	523	IR spectral data confirmed formation of ester bonding in the conjugates .
19719056	5	596	Etodolac contents were evaluated by UV - spectrophotometric analysis .
19719056	6	664	The molecular weights were determined by measuring viscosity using the Mark - Howink - Sakurada equation .
19719056	7	766	In vitro hydrolysis of ED was done in aqueous buffers ( pH 1 . 2 , 7 . 4 , 9 ) and in 80 % ( v / v ) human plasma ( pH 7 . 4 ) .
19719056	8	877	At pH 9 , a higher rate of etodolac release from ED was observed as compared to aqueous buffer of pH 7 . 4 and 80 % human plasma ( pH 7 . 4 ) , following first - order kinetics .
19719056	9	1044	In vivo investigations were performed in animals .
19719056	10	1094	Acute analgesic and antiinflammatory activities were ascertained using acetic acid induced writhing model ( mice ) and carrageenan - induced rat paw edema model , respectively .
19719056	11	1266	In comparison to control , E and ED1 - ED4 showed highly significant analgesic and antiinflammatory activities ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
19719056	12	1386	Biological evaluation suggested that conjugates ( ED1 - ED4 ) retained comparable analgesic and antiinflammatory activities with remarkably reduced ulcerogenicity as compared to their parent drug - - etodolac .
19721134	0	0	The antiarrhythmic effect and possible ionic mechanisms of pilocarpine on animal models .
19721134	1	89	This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pilocarpine and explore the underlying ionic mechanism , using both aconitine - induced rat and ouabain - induced guinea pig arrhythmia models .
19721134	2	279	Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free - calcium concentrations ( [ Ca ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) ) in isolated myocytes .
19721134	3	397	The current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed onset of arrhythmias , decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation , reduced arrhythmia score , and increased the survival time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs . [ Ca ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine .
19721134	4	762	Moreover , M ( 3 ) - muscarinic acetylcholine receptor ( mAChR ) antagonist 4 - DAMP ( 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine - methiodide ) partially abolished the beneficial effects of pilocarpine .
19721134	5	946	These data suggest that pilocarpine produced antiarrhythmic actions on arrhythmic rat and guinea pig models induced by aconitine or ouabain via stimulating the cardiac M ( 3 ) - mAChR .
19721134	6	1126	The mechanism may be related to the improvement of Ca ( 2 + ) handling .
19761039	0	0	Effect of Hibiscus rosa sinensis on reserpine - induced neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in rats .
19761039	1	107	Effect of methanolic extract of Hibiscus rosa sinensis ( 100 - 300 mg / kg ) was studied on reserpine - induced orofacial dyskinesia and neurochemical alterations .
19761039	2	263	The rats were treated with intraperitoneal reserpine ( 1 mg / kg , ip ) for 3 days every other day .
19761039	3	358	On day 5 , vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min .
19761039	4	441	Reserpine treated rats significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions however , coadministration of Hibiscus rosa sinensis roots extract ( 100 , 200 and 300 mg / kg , per orally ) attenuated the effects .
19761039	5	664	Biochemical analysis of brain revealed that the reserpine treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) and glutathione reductase ( GSH ) , an index of oxidative stress process .
19761039	6	913	Coadministration of extract significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and reversed the decrease in brain SOD , CAT and GSH levels .
19761039	7	1046	The results of the present study suggested that Hibiscus rosa sinensis had a protective role against reserpine - induced orofacial dyskinesia and oxidative stress .
19893084	0	0	Dynamic response of blood vessel in acute renal failure .
19893084	1	57	In this study we postulated that during acute renal failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected , and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels .
19893084	2	294	The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered , but also dynamics of this response , was used in this paper .
19893084	3	500	Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin - treated animals .
19893084	4	633	The beneficial effects of vitamin C administration to gentamicin - treated animals are also confirmed through : lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium .
19893084	5	814	The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in gentamicin - treated animals ( 8 . 07 + / - 1 . 7 s vs . 5 . 64 + / - 0 . 18 s ) .
19893084	6	969	Vitamin C administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values .
19893084	7	1058	The pressure dynamic properties , quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic , confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin - treated animals and beneficial effects of vitamin C administration .
19917396	0	0	Reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus in a pediatric heart transplant recipient : case report .
19917396	1	112	Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation .
19917396	2	203	However , adverse effects include cardiac toxicity .
19917396	3	254	Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation .
19917396	4	357	The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography .
19917396	5	521	Initially , allograft rejection was feared ; however , myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy ; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected .
19917396	6	718	The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time ; thus , tacrolimus dosage was reduced .
19917396	7	826	Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur , as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy .
19917396	8	997	Thus , we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy .
19917396	9	1074	In patients receiving tacrolimus therapy , blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement .
19923525	0	0	Nimodipine prevents memory impairment caused by nitroglycerin - induced hypotension in adult mice .
19923525	1	97	BACKGROUND : Hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction .
19923525	2	235	We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine ( NIMO ) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin ( NTG ) - induced hypotension would preserve long - term associative memory .
19923525	3	397	METHODS : The passive avoidance ( PA ) paradigm was used to assess memory retention .
19923525	4	479	For PA training , latencies ( seconds ) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered .
19923525	5	631	Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial .
19923525	6	687	Ninety - six Swiss - Webster mice ( 30 - 35 g , 6 - 8 wk ) , were randomized into 6 groups 1 ) saline ( control ) , 2 ) NTG immediately after learning , 3 ) NTG 3 h after learning , 4 ) NTG and NIMO , 5 ) vehicle , and 6 ) NIMO alone .
19923525	7	897	The extent of hypotension and changes in brain tissue oxygenation ( PbtO ( 2 ) ) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals .
19923525	8	1045	RESULTS : All groups exhibited similar training latencies ( 17 . 0 + / - 4 . 6 s ) .
19923525	9	1120	Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time ( 178 + / - 156 s ) compared with those injected with saline , NTG + NIMO , or delayed NTG ( 580 + / - 81 s , 557 + / - 67 s , and 493 + / - 146 s , respectively ) .
19923525	10	1353	A Kruskal - Wallis 1 - way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups ( H = 15 . 34 ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
19923525	11	1485	In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies , the same dose of NTG ( n = 3 ) and NTG + NIMO ( n = 3 ) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85 . 9 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg sem to 31 . 6 + / - 0 . 8 mm Hg sem and from 86 . 2 + / - 3 . 7 mm Hg sem to 32 . 6 + / - 0 . 2 mm Hg sem , respectively .
19923525	12	1777	Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with NIMO alone decreased from 88 . 1 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg to 80 . 0 + / - 2 . 9 mm Hg .
19923525	13	1895	The intergroup difference was statistically significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
19923525	14	1963	PbtO ( 2 ) decreased from 51 . 7 + / - 4 . 5 mm Hg sem to 33 . 8 + / - 5 . 2 mm Hg sem in the NTG group and from 38 . 6 + / - 6 . 1 mm Hg sem to 25 . 4 + / - 2 . 0 mm Hg sem in the NTG + NIMO groups , respectively .
19923525	15	2150	There were no significant differences among groups .
19923525	16	2202	CONCLUSION : In a PA retention paradigm , the injection of NTG immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long - term associative memory in mice , whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect .
19923525	17	2416	NIMO attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long - term memory caused by NTG but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension .
19923525	18	2557	The observed effect of NIMO may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension , because there were no differences in the PbtO ( 2 ) indices among groups .
19940105	0	0	Metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of Parkinson ' s disease .
19940105	1	108	Metabotropic glutamate ( mGlu ) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) .
19940105	2	308	Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes , mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia , but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of PD is not known .
19940105	3	488	The effects of N , N ' - dibenzhydrylethane - 1 , 2 - diamine dihydrochloride ( AMN082 ) , the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors , were thus tested in different rodent models of PD .
19940105	4	677	Here , we show that oral ( 5 mg / kg ) or intrastriatal administration ( 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 nmol ) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol - induced catalepsy in rats .
19940105	5	820	AMN082 ( 2 . 5 and 5 mg / kg ) reduces apomorphine - induced rotations in unilateral 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) - lesioned rats .
19940105	6	939	In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients , 5 mg / kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6 - OHDA - lesioned rats .
19940105	7	1135	In addition , AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol - induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor - dependent manner in wild - type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice .
19940105	8	1297	Higher doses of AMN082 ( 10 and 20 mg / kg p . o . ) have no effect on the same models of PD .
19940105	9	1384	Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity .
19940105	10	1519	Selective ligands of mGlu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies .
19944333	0	0	Sorafenib - induced acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery spasm .
19944333	1	76	A 65 - year - old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma was admitted due to continuing chest pain at rest .
19944333	2	180	Two weeks before his admission , sorafenib had been started .
19944333	3	240	He was diagnosed with non - ST - elevation myocardial infarction by laboratory data and electrocardiogram .
19944333	4	343	Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed subendocardial infarction .
19944333	5	424	However , there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography .
19944333	6	492	Coronary artery spasm was induced by a provocative test .
19944333	7	549	Cessation of sorafenib and administration of Ca - channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms , but relapse occurred after resumption of sorafenib .
19944333	8	704	Addition of oral nicorandil reduced his symptoms and maintained stable angina status .
19944333	9	790	We report the first case of sorafenib - induced coronary artery spasm .
19944333	10	859	Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival .
19944333	11	979	On the other hand , the Rho / ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm .
19944333	12	1087	Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho / ROCK pathway by sorafenib use .
19944736	0	0	A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB .
19944736	1	111	The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) and / or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound .
19944736	2	407	A Tween 80 - coated poly - L - lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system , able to trespass the BBB .
19944736	3	539	Tacrine , administered in LiCl pre - treated rats , induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage .
19944736	4	658	The toxic effects of tacrine - loaded poly - L - lactid acid nanoparticles ( 5mg / kg ) , a saline solution of tacrine ( 5mg / kg ) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i . p . administration in LiCl - pre - treated Wistar rats .
19944736	5	899	All the animals treated with tacrine - loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms , i . e . epileptic onset , with respect to those animals treated with the free compound ( 10 min vs . 22 min respectively ) .
19944736	6	1125	In addition , tacrine - loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals , while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60 % of animals .
19944736	7	1332	Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control ( saline - treated ) group of animals .
19944736	8	1423	In conclusion , the evaluation of time - to - onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine - lithium model of epilepsy in the rat , could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass ( or not ) the BBB in vivo .
19996135	0	0	High - dose tranexamic Acid is associated with nonischemic clinical seizures in cardiac surgical patients .
19996135	1	105	BACKGROUND : In 2 separate centers , we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1 . 3 % to 3 . 8 % in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures .
19996135	2	307	These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high - dose tranexamic acid ( TXA ) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage .
19996135	3	470	The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery .
19996135	4	631	METHODS : An in - depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures .
19996135	5	737	Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients , and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies .
19996135	6	889	RESULTS : Twenty - one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury , but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients .
19996135	7	1052	All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities .
19996135	8	1130	All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg / kg , had a mean age of 69 . 9 years , and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures .
19996135	9	1344	All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass .
19996135	10	1407	No evidence of brain ischemic , metabolic , or hyperthermia - induced causes for their seizures was apparent .
19996135	11	1513	CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that use of high - dose TXA in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open - chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients .
2004	0	0	Electrocardiographic changes and cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving psychotropic drugs .
2004	1	95	Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life - threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs , either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants .
2004	2	257	Although most patients were receiving several drugs , Mellaril ( thioridazine ) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia , one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman .
2004	3	451	Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine ( chlorpromazine ) .
2004	4	543	Aventyl ( nortriptyline ) and Elavil ( amitriptyline ) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman .
2004	5	657	Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients .
2004	6	736	The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock ; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one .
2004	7	992	The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped .
2004	8	1095	Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger ; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease .
2004	9	1202	Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs .
2004	10	1354	A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs .
2004015	0	0	Sensitivity of erythroid progenitor colonies to erythropoietin in azidothymidine treated immunodeficient mice .
2004015	1	111	The anaemia induced by 3 ' - azido - 3 ' dideoxythymidine ( AZT ) is poorly understood .
2004015	2	190	We have used a murine model of AIDS , infection of female C57BL / 6 mice with LP - BM5 murine leukaemia ( MuLV ) virus , to determine if AZT - induced anaemia is due , in part , to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors ( BFU - e ) to erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
2004015	3	446	Mice in the early stage of LP - BM5 MuLV disease were given AZT in their drinking water at 1 . 0 and 2 . 5 mg / ml .
2004015	4	554	AZT produced anaemia in both groups , in a dose - dependent fashion .
2004015	5	620	Despite the anaemia , the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU - e in AZT treated mice increased up to five - fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment .
2004015	6	807	Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving AZT for 15 d than for infected , untreated mice .
2004015	7	968	By day 30 , sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU - e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals .
2004015	8	1116	The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in AZT treated mice were appropriate for the degree of anaemia observed when compared with phenylhydrazine ( PHZ ) treated mice .
2004015	9	1282	The numbers of BFU - e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in AZT and PHZ treated mice with similar degrees of anaemia .
2004015	10	1437	However , reticulocytosis was inappropriate for the degree of anaemia observed in AZT treated infected mice .
2004015	11	1545	AZT - induced peripheral anaemia in the face of increased numbers of BFU - e and increased levels of plasma EPO suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation .
20042557	0	0	Sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair .
20042557	1	138	OBJECTIVE : To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for hip fracture repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of postoperative delirium .
20042557	2	333	PATIENTS AND METHODS : We performed a double - blind , randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients ( > or = 65 years ) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation .
20042557	3	608	Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index ( BIS ) , and patients were randomized to receive either deep ( BIS , approximately 50 ) or light ( BIS , > or = 80 ) sedation .
20042557	4	817	Postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( Third Edition Revised ) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery .
20042557	5	1049	RESULTS : From April 2 , 2005 , through October 30 , 2008 , a total of 114 patients were randomized .
20042557	6	1145	The prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group ( 11 / 57 [ 19 % ] vs 23 / 57 [ 40 % ] in the deep sedation group ; P = . 02 ) , indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4 . 7 patients treated with light sedation .
20042557	7	1411	The mean + / - SD number of days of delirium during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group ( 0 . 5 + / - 1 . 5 days vs 1 . 4 + / - 4 . 0 days ; P = . 01 ) .
20042557	8	1590	CONCLUSION : The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50 % compared with deep sedation .
20042557	9	1724	Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple , safe , and cost - effective intervention for preventing postoperative delirium in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted .
20103708	0	0	The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy .
20103708	1	76	OBJECTIVE : Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure , which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
20103708	2	226	Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis .
20103708	3	360	Here , we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy .
20103708	4	459	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients , a streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2 ( - / - ) mice , and cultured human mesangial cells .
20103708	5	733	RESULTS : The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels .
20103708	6	853	In the animal study , Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin - induced renal damage .
20103708	7	963	This is evident by Nrf2 ( - / - ) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2 ( + / + ) mice .
20103708	8	1121	Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2 - mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is , at least , partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 ) and reduction of extracellular matrix production .
20103708	9	1389	In human renal mesangial cells , high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes .
20103708	10	1516	Furthermore , activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF - beta1 in a dose - dependent manner , whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF - beta1 transcription and fibronectin production .
20103708	11	1735	CONCLUSIONS : This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy , suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy .
20164825	0	0	Metformin prevents experimental gentamicin - induced nephropathy by a mitochondria - dependent pathway .
20164825	1	100	The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients .
20164825	2	267	Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity .
20164825	3	356	Mitochondrial analysis , respiration intensity , levels of reactive oxygen species , permeability transition , and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration .
20164825	4	548	Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin - mediated acute renal failure .
20164825	5	623	This was accompanied by a lower activity of N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase , together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems .
20164825	6	784	Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration .
20164825	7	885	These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function .
20164825	8	1028	We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components ( cytochrome c , NADH ) , probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores .
20164825	9	1180	These injuries , partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain , were significantly decreased by metformin .
20164825	10	1326	Thus , our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis .
20195852	0	0	Risk of nephropathy after consumption of nonionic contrast media by children undergoing cardiac angiography : a prospective study .
20195852	1	130	Despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast media - induced nephropathy ( CIN ) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures , the studies in pediatrics are limited , with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography .
20195852	2	430	This prospective study determined the incidence of CIN for two nonionic contrast media ( CM ) , iopromide and iohexol , among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of CM and the presence of cyanosis .
20195852	3	702	The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide ( group A , n = 40 ) or iohexol ( group B , n = 40 ) .
20195852	4	819	Serum sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , and creatinine ( Cr ) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values , then measured again at 12 - , 24 - , and 48 - h intervals after CM use .
20195852	5	997	Urine samples for Na and Cr also were checked at the same intervals .
20195852	6	1066	Risk of renal failure , Injury to the kidney , Failure of kidney function , Loss of kidney function , and End - stage renal damage ( RIFLE criteria ) were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population .
20195852	7	1275	Accordingly , among the 15 CIN patients ( 18 . 75 % ) , 7 . 5 % of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3 . 75 % had renal injury , whereas 5 % of group B had increased risk and 2 . 5 % had renal injury .
20195852	8	1471	Whereas 33 . 3 % of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM , the percentage increased to 66 . 6 % among those who received larger doses , with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM ( p = 0 . 014 ) .
20195852	9	1744	Among the 15 patients with CIN , 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases , but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients ( p = 0 . 243 ) .
20195852	10	1917	Although clinically silent , CIN is not rare in pediatrics .
20195852	11	1976	The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM , nor on the presence of cyanosis , and although CIN usually is reversible , more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children .
2021202	0	0	Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged isoflurane - induced hypotension in humans .
2021202	1	91	The effect of isoflurane - induced hypotension on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects .
2021202	2	219	Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) and effective renal plasma flow ( ERPF ) were measured by inulin and para - aminohippurate ( PAH ) clearance , respectively .
2021202	3	370	Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl , nitrous oxide , oxygen , and isoflurane .
2021202	4	450	Hypotension was induced for 236 . 9 + / - 15 . 1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59 . 8 + / - 0 . 4 mmHg .
2021202	5	608	GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during hypotension .
2021202	6	711	Postoperatively , ERPF returned to preoperative values , whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values .
2021202	7	815	Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when hypotension was induced , allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow .
2021202	8	959	We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane - induced hypotension and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed .
20304337	0	0	Brainstem dysgenesis in an infant prenatally exposed to cocaine .
20304337	1	65	Many authors described the effects on the fetus of maternal cocaine abuse during pregnancy .
20304337	2	157	Vasoconstriction appears to be the common mechanism of action leading to a wide range of fetal anomalies .
20304337	3	263	We report on an infant with multiple cranial - nerve involvement attributable to brainstem dysgenesis , born to a cocaine - addicted mother .
20331935	0	0	A cross - sectional evaluation of the effect of risperidone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on bone mineral density in boys .
20331935	1	135	OBJECTIVE : The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia on trabecular bone mineral density ( BMD ) in children and adolescents .
20331935	2	317	METHOD : Medically healthy 7 - to 17 - year - old males chronically treated , in a naturalistic setting , with risperidone were recruited for this cross - sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007 .
20331935	3	559	Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted .
20331935	4	626	The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review , and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record .
20331935	5	755	Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography , and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry .
20331935	6	948	RESULTS : Hyperprolactinemia was present in 49 % of 83 boys ( n = 41 ) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2 . 9 years .
20331935	7	1065	Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia .
20331935	8	1173	As expected , bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity .
20331935	9	1247	After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores , serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius ( P < . 03 ) .
20331935	10	1438	Controlling for relevant covariates , we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius ( P = . 03 ) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine ( P < . 05 ) .
20331935	11	1666	These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non - Hispanic white patients .
20331935	12	1765	Of 13 documented fractures , 3 occurred after risperidone and SSRIs were started , and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia .
20331935	13	1901	CONCLUSIONS : This is the first study to link risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents .
20331935	14	2046	Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues .
20394767	0	0	Fear - potentiated startle , but not light - enhanced startle , is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs .
20394767	1	91	RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES : The light - enhanced startle paradigm ( LES ) is suggested to model anxiety , because of the non - specific cue and the long - term effect .
20394767	2	248	In contrast , the fear - potentiated startle ( FPS ) is suggested to model conditioned fear .
20394767	3	336	However , the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar .
20394767	4	415	The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms .
20394767	5	661	METHODS : Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha ( 2 ) - adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine ( 0 . 25 - 1 . 0mg / kg ) , the 5 - HT ( 2C ) receptor agonist m - chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP , 0 . 5 - 2 . 0mg / kg ) or the GABA ( A ) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole ( PTZ , 3 - 30mg / kg ) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS .
20394767	6	976	RESULTS : None of the drugs enhanced LES , whereas mCPP increased percentage FPS and yohimbine increased absolute FPS values .
20394767	7	1100	Furthermore , yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES , while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and PTZ suppressed baseline startle in the FPS .
20394767	8	1283	CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm , none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response .
20394767	9	1401	Thus , a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS .
20466178	0	0	Rosaceiform dermatitis associated with topical tacrolimus treatment .
20466178	1	69	We describe herein 3 patients who developed rosacea - like dermatitis eruptions while using 0 . 03 % or 0 . 1 % tacrolimus ointment for facial dermatitis .
20466178	2	216	Skin biopsy specimens showed telangiectasia and noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous tissue formation in the papillary to mid dermis .
20466178	3	352	Continuous topical use of immunomodulators such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus should be regarded as a potential cause of rosaceiform dermatitis , although many cases have not been reported .
20510337	0	0	Coenzyme Q10 treatment ameliorates acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mice .
20510337	1	75	The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i . p . injection of cisplatin ( 5 mg / kg ) .
20510337	2	227	Coenzyme Q10 treatment ( 10 mg / kg / day , i . p . ) was applied for 6 consecutive days , starting 1 day before cisplatin administration .
20510337	3	355	Coenzyme Q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cisplatin .
20510337	4	473	Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms ( reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity ) , suppressed lipid peroxidation , decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor - alpha , nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration , and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration .
20510337	5	867	Also , histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment .
20510337	6	976	Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the cisplatin - induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase , nuclear factor - kappaB , caspase - 3 and p53 in renal tissue .
20510337	7	1187	It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice .
2051906	0	0	Reversible cholestasis with bile duct injury following azathioprine therapy .
2051906	1	77	A case report .
2051906	2	92	A 67 - year - old patient , with primary polymyositis and without previous evidence of liver disease , developed clinical and biochemical features of severe cholestasis 3 months after initiation of azathioprine therapy .
2051906	3	306	Liver biopsy showed cholestasis with both cytological and architectural alterations of interlobular bile ducts .
2051906	4	418	Azathioprine withdrawal resulted after 7 weeks in the resolution of clinical and biochemical abnormalities .
2051906	5	526	It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible azathioprine - induced cholestasis associated with histological evidence of bile duct injury .
20533999	0	0	Dopamine is not essential for the development of methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity .
20533999	1	88	It is widely believed that dopamine ( DA ) mediates methamphetamine ( METH ) - induced toxicity to brain dopaminergic neurons , because drugs that interfere with DA neurotransmission decrease toxicity , whereas drugs that increase DA neurotransmission enhance toxicity .
20533999	2	350	However , temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain DA neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data .
20533999	3	486	Here we show that the recently reported ability of L - dihydroxyphenylalanine to reverse the protective effect of alpha - methyl - para - tyrosine on METH - induced DA neurotoxicity is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature .
20533999	4	714	Further , we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain DA develop METH neurotoxicity , as long as the thermic effects of METH are preserved .
20533999	5	874	In addition , we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain DA deficits develop METH - induced dopaminergic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain .
20533999	6	1076	Taken together , these findings demonstrate that DA is not essential for the development of METH - induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and suggest that mechanisms independent of DA warrant more intense investigation .
20552622	0	0	Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia triggered by salbutamol : case report and review of the literature .
20552622	1	109	CASE : A 49 - year - old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing .
20552622	2	184	On electrocardiogram , episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing ; 24 - hour Holter monitoring recorded several events .
20552622	3	336	The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol , but recurred a year later .
20552622	4	416	The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol .
20552622	5	509	After stopping the beta - agonist , and after a week with the atenolol , the arrhythmia disappeared .
20552622	6	606	DISCUSSION : Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia ( SIAT ) is a rare phenomenon .
20552622	7	689	Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature .
20552622	8	756	This article summarizes all the cases published , creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to SIAT .
20552622	9	884	It discusses demographics , clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia , postulated mechanisms of SIAT , and different treatment possibilities such as medications , surgery , and radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) .
20552622	10	1105	CONCLUSION : Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for SIAT .
20552622	11	1178	Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report , it is logical to think that a beta - agonist like salbutamol ( known to induce tachycardia ) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta - blocker such as atenolol ( that blocks the adrenergic activity ) may relieve it .
2055425	0	0	The ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by streptozotocin - induced diabetes mellitus . 1 .
2055425	1	150	The effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in streptozotocin - diabetic rats were investigated . 2 .
2055425	2	286	Diabetes of 2 months duration resulted in decreases in body weight and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition ; effects which were prevented by insulin treatment . 3 .
2055425	3	519	Insulin treatment also prevented the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation , ATP , and bethanechol . 4 .
2055425	4	680	Diabetes of 4 months duration also resulted in decreases in body weight , and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition , effects which were reversed by insulin treatment for the final 2 months of the study . 5 .
2055425	5	954	Insulin treatment reversed the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation , ATP , and bethanechol . 6 .
2055425	6	1109	The data indicate that the effects of streptozotocin - induced diabetes on urinary bladder function are both prevented and reversed by insulin treatment .
20558148	0	0	Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol - induced catalepsy .
20558148	1	130	The inferior colliculus ( IC ) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information , but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system .
20558148	2	348	Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing , escape - like behavior , and immobility .
20558148	3	582	However , the nature of this immobility is still unclear .
20558148	4	639	The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid - mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically ( 1 or 0 . 5 mg / kg ) in rats .
20558148	5	857	Haloperidol - induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists , MK - 801 ( 15 or 30 mmol / 0 . 5 microl ) and AP7 ( 10 or 20 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) , or of the NMDA receptor agonist N - methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA , 20 or 30 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) .
20558148	6	1142	The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK - 801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy , as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar .
20558148	7	1372	Accordingly , intracollicular microinjection of NMDA increased the latency to step down the bar .
20558148	8	1468	These findings suggest that glutamate - mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol - induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity .
20635749	0	0	Severe congestive heart failure patient on amiodarone presenting with myxedemic coma : a case report .
20635749	1	101	This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone - induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure ( CHF ) .
20635749	2	244	To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy .
20635749	3	375	Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20 % with treatment .
20635749	4	486	The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine ( T4 ) or intravenous tri - iodo - thyronine ( T3 ) .
20635749	5	583	Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism , and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels .
20635749	6	763	This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients .
20635749	7	881	The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among CHF patients presenting with hypotension , weakness or other unexplained symptoms .
20683499	0	0	Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L . , crocin on streptozocin - induced model of sporadic Alzheimer ' s disease in male rats .
20683499	1	136	BACKGROUND : The involvement of water - soluble carotenoids , crocins , as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L . extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed .
20683499	2	318	In the present study , the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer ' s disease induced by intracerebroventricular ( icv ) streptozocin ( STZ ) in male rats was investigated .
20683499	3	485	METHODS : Male adult Wistar rats ( n = 90 and 260 - 290 g ) were divided into 1 , control ; 2 and 3 , crocins ( 15 and 30 mg / kg ) ; 4 , STZ ; 5 and 6 , STZ + crocins ( 15 and 30 mg / kg ) groups .
20683499	4	663	In Alzheimer ' s disease groups , rats were injected with STZ - icv bilaterally ( 3 mg / kg ) in first day and 3 days later , a similar STZ - icv application was repeated .
20683499	5	823	In STZ + crocin animal groups , crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg / kg , i . p . , one day pre - surgery and continued for three weeks .
20683499	6	959	Prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days .
20683499	7	1027	However , the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm , and for spatial cognition evaluation , Y - maze task was used .
20683499	8	1179	RESULTS : It was found out that crocin ( 30 mg / kg ) - treated STZ - injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y - maze than vehicle - treated STZ - injected rats .
20683499	9	1349	In addition , crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ - injected group in passive avoidance test .
20683499	10	1510	CONCLUSION : Therefore , these results demonstrate the effectiveness of crocin ( 30 mg / kg ) in antagonizing the cognitive deficits caused by STZ - icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ' s disease .
20705401	0	0	Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine - induced psychosis in a Japanese population .
20705401	1	105	BACKGROUND : Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia .
20705401	2	251	The serotonin 6 ( 5 - HT6 ) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics , such as clozapine and olanzapine , and d - amphetamine - induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist .
20705401	3	507	In addition , the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d - amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats .
20705401	4	669	These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia , and the above evidence suggests that altered 5 - HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders .
20705401	5	877	The symptoms of methamphetamine ( METH ) - induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia .
20705401	6	987	Therefore , we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5 - HT6 gene ( HTR6 ) with METH - induced psychosis .
20705401	7	1096	METHOD : Using five tagging SNPs ( rs6693503 , rs1805054 , rs4912138 , rs3790757 and rs9659997 ) , we conducted a genetic association analysis of case - control samples ( 197 METH - induced psychosis patients and 337 controls ) in the Japanese population .
20705401	8	1339	The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients .
20705401	9	1449	RESULTS : rs6693503 was associated with METH - induced psychosis patients in the allele / genotype - wise analysis .
20705401	10	1558	Moreover , this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction .
20705401	11	1635	In the haplotype - wise analysis , we detected an association between two markers ( rs6693503 and rs1805054 ) and three markers ( rs6693503 , rs1805054 and rs4912138 ) in HTR6 and METH - induced psychosis patients , respectively .
20705401	12	1854	CONCLUSION : HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH - induced psychosis in the Japanese population .
20727411	0	0	Neural correlates of S - ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency .
20727411	1	90	The glutamatergic N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia .
20727411	2	206	Administered to healthy volunteers , a subanesthetic dose of the non - competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia .
20727411	3	401	In patients with schizophrenia , ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness , supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction .
20727411	4	542	In a counterbalanced , placebo - controlled , double - blind study design , healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S - ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected .
20727411	5	763	During the scanning period , subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks ( phonological , lexical and semantic ) .
20727411	6	886	Ketamine - induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) .
20727411	7	1000	Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology .
20727411	8	1050	Post - hoc t - tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency , while the phonological domain remained unaffected .
20727411	9	1259	Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency , but not for semantic verbal fluency .
20727411	10	1430	Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia , particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions .
20727411	11	1596	Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia .
20735774	0	0	Long - term prognosis for transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver failure .
20735774	1	94	BACKGROUND : The prognosis for transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver failure remains unknown .
20735774	2	210	AIM : To examine whether paracetamol - induced acute liver failure increases long - term mortality .
20735774	3	305	METHODS : We followed up all transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver injury , hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984 - 2004 .
20735774	4	470	We compared age - specific mortality rates from 1 year post - discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not .
20735774	5	650	RESULTS : We included 641 patients .
20735774	6	685	On average , age - specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol - induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure ( adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1 . 70 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 - 2 . 85 ) , but the association was age - dependent , and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease , whereas suicides were frequent in both groups .
20735774	7	1048	These observations speak against long - term effects of acute liver failure .
20735774	8	1123	More likely , the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure .
20735774	9	1292	CONCLUSIONS : Paracetamol - induced acute liver failure did not affect long - term mortality .
20735774	10	1381	Clinical follow - up may be justified by the cause of the liver failure , but not by the liver failure itself .
20973483	0	0	In vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A2A / A1 receptor antagonist in animal models of Parkinson ' s disease .
20973483	1	113	The in vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A ( 2A ) / A ( 1 ) receptor antagonist in several animal models of Parkinson ' s disease is described .
20973483	2	255	Discovery and scale - up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail , highlighting optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10 . 0 % to 30 . 5 % .
20973483	3	418	Compound 1 is a potent A ( 2A ) / A ( 1 ) receptor antagonist in vitro ( A ( 2A ) K ( i ) = 4 . 1 nM ; A ( 1 ) K ( i ) = 17 . 0 nM ) that has excellent activity , after oral administration , across a number of animal models of Parkinson ' s disease including mouse and rat models of haloperidol - induced catalepsy , mouse model of reserpine - induced akinesia , rat 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) lesion model of drug - induced rotation , and MPTP - treated non - human primate model .
21294084	0	0	Effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical epileptic discharges in penicillin - induced epilepsy model in rats .
21294084	1	131	AIM : Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control epileptic activity , but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined .
21294084	2	336	The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin - induced epilepsy model .
21294084	3	483	MATERIAL AND METHODS : Twenty - five Sprague - Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes .
21294084	4	568	In group - 1 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group - 2 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was on ( 185 Hz , 0 . 5V , 1V , 2V , and 5V for 60 sec ) following penicillin G injection intracortically .
21294084	5	751	In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8 l saline injection intracortically .
21294084	6	844	EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin - G injection , and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency , amplitude , and power spectrum .
21294084	7	1040	RESULTS : High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute penicillin - induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity .
21294084	8	1185	In the control group , hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation .
21294084	9	1320	CONCLUSION : Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges .
21294084	10	1520	These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with epilepsy .
21418164	0	0	CCNU ( lomustine ) toxicity in dogs : a retrospective study ( 2002 - 07 ) .
21418164	1	68	OBJECTIVE : To describe the incidence of haematological , renal , hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities in tumour - bearing dogs receiving 1 - ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - 3 - cyclohexyl - 1 - nitrosourea ( CCNU ) .
21418164	2	257	DESIGN : The medical records of 206 dogs that were treated with CCNU at the Melbourne Veterinary Specialist Centre between February 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively evaluated .
21418164	3	443	RESULTS : Of the 206 dogs treated with CCNU , 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of toxicity .
21418164	4	554	CCNU was used most commonly in the treatment of lymphoma , mast cell tumour , brain tumour , histiocytic tumours and epitheliotropic lymphoma .
21418164	5	694	Throughout treatment , 56 . 9 % of dogs experienced neutropenia , 34 . 2 % experienced anaemia and 14 . 2 % experienced thrombocytopenia .
21418164	6	821	Gastrointestinal toxicosis was detected in 37 . 8 % of dogs , the most common sign of which was vomiting ( 24 . 3 % ) .
21418164	7	931	Potential renal toxicity and elevated alanine transaminase ( ALT ) concentration were reported in 12 . 2 % and 48 . 8 % of dogs , respectively .
21418164	8	1066	The incidence of hepatic failure was 1 . 2 % .
21418164	9	1109	CONCLUSIONS : CCNU - associated toxicity in dogs is common , but is usually not life threatening .
2220369	0	0	Central vein thrombosis and topical dipivalyl epinephrine .
2220369	1	59	A report is given on an 83 - year - old female who acquired central vein thrombosis in her seeing eye one day after having started topical medication with dipivalyl epinephrine for advanced glaucoma discovered in the other eye .
2220369	2	283	From present knowledge about the effects of adrenergic eye drops on ocular blood circulation , it is difficult to suggest an association between the two events , which may be coincidental only .
2257294	0	0	Benzylacyclouridine reverses azidothymidine - induced marrow suppression without impairment of anti - human immunodeficiency virus activity .
2257294	1	137	Increased extracellular concentrations of uridine ( Urd ) have been reported to reduce , in vitro , azidothymidine ( AZT ) - induced inhibition of human granulocyte - macrophage progenitor cells without impairment of its antihuman immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) activity .
2257294	2	397	Because of the clinical toxicities associated with chronic Urd administration , the ability of benzylacyclouridine ( BAU ) to effect , in vivo , AZT - induced anemia and leukopenia was assessed .
2257294	3	585	This agent inhibits Urd catabolism and , in vivo , increases the plasma concentration of Urd in a dose - dependent manner , without Urd - related toxicity .
2257294	4	734	In mice rendered anemic and leukopenic by the administration of AZT for 28 days in drinking water ( 1 . 5 mg / mL ) , the continued administration of AZT plus daily BAU ( 300 mg / kg , orally ) partially reversed AZT - induced anemia and leukopenia ( P less than . 05 ) , increased peripheral reticulocytes ( to 4 . 9 % , P less than . 01 ) , increased cellularity in the marrow , and improved megaloblastosis .
2257294	5	1118	When coadministered with AZT from the onset of drug administration , BAU reduced AZT - induced marrow toxicity .
2257294	6	1227	In vitro , at a concentration of 100 mumol / L , BAU possesses minimal anti - HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of AZT to reverse the HIV - induced cytopathic effect in MT4 cells .
2257294	7	1411	The clinical and biochemical implications of these findings are discussed .
2320800	0	0	Lethal anuria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy in a breast cancer patient with an impaired renal function .
2320800	1	121	A sixty - year - old woman with advanced breast cancer , previously treated with cisplatin , developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with anuria , the day after 5 g / m2 bolus ifosfamide .
2320800	2	307	Postrenal failure was excluded by echography .
2320800	3	353	A prerenal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension , due to an increasing ascitis , occurring just before anuria .
2320800	4	510	However , correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function .
2320800	5	592	Ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies .
2320800	6	664	We strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide , occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypotension .
2320800	7	870	We recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion .
2322844	0	0	Nociceptive effects induced by intrathecal administration of prostaglandin D2 , E2 , or F2 alpha to conscious mice .
2322844	1	114	The effects of intrathecal administration of prostaglandins on pain responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and acetic acid writhing tests .
2322844	2	276	Prostaglandin D2 ( 0 . 5 - 3 ng / mouse ) had a hyperalgesic action on the response to a hot plate during a 3 - 60 min period after injection .
2322844	3	409	Prostaglandin E2 showed a hyperalgesic effect at doses of 1 pg to 10 ng / mouse , but the effect lasted shorter ( 3 - 30 min ) than that of prostaglandin D2 .
2322844	4	560	Similar results were obtained by acetic acid writhing tests .
2322844	5	621	The hyperalgesic effect of prostaglandin D2 was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist ( greater than or equal to 100 ng ) but not by AH6809 , a prostanoid EP1 - receptor antagonist .
2322844	6	822	Conversely , prostaglandin E2 - induced hyperalgesia was blocked by AH6809 ( greater than or equal to 500 ng ) but not by the substance P antagonist .
2322844	7	967	Prostaglandin F2 alpha had little effect on pain responses .
2322844	8	1027	These results demonstrate that both prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 exert hyperalgesia in the spinal cord , but in different ways .
2334179	0	0	D - penicillamine in the treatment of localized scleroderma .
2334179	1	59	Localized scleroderma has no recognized internal organ involvement but may be disfiguring and disabling when the cutaneous lesions are extensive or affect children .
2334179	2	224	There is no accepted or proven treatment for localized scleroderma .
2334179	3	292	Case reports of 11 patients with severe , extensive localized scleroderma who were treated with D - penicillamine are summarized in this article .
2334179	4	435	This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 ( 64 % ) of 11 patients .
2334179	5	532	Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients , skin softening in 5 , and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children .
2334179	6	730	Joint stiffness and contractures also improved .
2334179	7	778	The dose of D - penicillamine associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg / kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months .
2334179	8	928	D - Penicillamine caused nephrotic syndrome in 1 patient and milder reversible proteinuria in 3 other patients ; none developed renal insufficiency .
2334179	9	1074	These data suggest that D - penicillamine may be effective in severe cases of localized scleroderma .
2339463	0	0	Cerebral sinus thrombosis as a potential hazard of antifibrinolytic treatment in menorrhagia .
2339463	1	94	We describe a 42 - year - old woman who developed superior sagittal and left transverse sinus thrombosis associated with prolonged epsilon - aminocaproic acid therapy for menorrhagia .
2339463	2	272	This antifibrinolytic agent has been used in women with menorrhagia to promote clotting and reduce blood loss .
2339463	3	383	Although increased risk of thromboembolic disease has been reported during treatment with epsilon - aminocaproic acid , cerebral sinus thrombosis has not been previously described .
2339463	4	561	Careful use of epsilon - aminocaproic acid therapy is recommended .
2343592	0	0	Seizure activity with imipenem therapy : incidence and risk factors .
2343592	1	68	Two elderly patients with a history of either cerebral vascular accident ( CVA ) or head trauma and no evidence of renal disease developed seizures while receiving maximum doses of imipenem / cilastatin .
2343592	2	268	Neither patient had reported previous seizures or seizure - like activity nor was receiving anticonvulsant agents .
2343592	3	381	All seizures were controlled with therapeutic doses of phenytoin .
2343592	4	447	Both patients had received maximum doses of other beta - lactam antibiotics without evidence of seizure activity .
2422478	0	0	Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa .
2422478	1	93	Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord .
2422478	2	339	The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla , coinciding with the raphe magnus .
2422478	3	500	In spontaneously hypertensive , stroke - prone rats , microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30 - 40 mm Hg , which was maximal 2 - 3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine ( 5 , 7 - DHT ) injected intracerebroventricularly .
2422478	4	860	However , intraspinal injection of 5 , 7 - DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension .
2422478	5	1030	Further , 5 , 7 - DHT lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle , one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells , did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection .
2422478	6	1284	It is concluded therefore that , unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa - induced hypotension via descending projections , the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa , either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle , or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem .
2435991	0	0	Antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of cibenzoline on canine ventricular arrhythmias .
2435991	1	87	Using two - stage coronary ligation - , digitalis - , and adrenaline - induced canine ventricular arrhythmias , antiarrhythmic effects of cibenzoline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determined .
2435991	2	331	Cibenzoline suppressed all the arrhythmias , and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24 - h coronary ligation , 48 - h coronary ligation , digitalis , and adrenaline were 1 . 9 + / - 0 . 9 ( by 8 mg / kg i . v . ) , 1 . 6 + / - 0 . 5 ( by 8 mg / kg i . v . ) , 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 2 ( by 2 mg / kg i . v . ) , and 3 . 5 + / - 1 . 3 ( by 5 mg / kg i . v . ) micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - SDM , n = 6 - 7 ) .
2435991	3	709	The concentration for adrenaline - induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhythmias .
2435991	4	833	This pharmacological profile is similar to those of mexiletine and tocainide , and all three drugs have central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant action .
2435991	5	983	Because cibenzoline had only weak hypotensive and sinus node depressive effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation arrhythmia dogs , its clinical usefulness is expected .
2466960	0	0	Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring during fluorouracil therapy : a prospective study .
2466960	1	87	Although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) therapy , this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion .
2466960	2	257	We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5 - FU infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic ST changes .
2466960	3	448	Patients were monitored for 23 + / - 4 hours before 5 - FU infusion , and 98 + / - 9 hours during 5 - FU infusion .
2466960	4	554	Anginal episodes were rare : only one patient had angina ( during 5 - FU infusion ) .
2466960	5	634	However , asymptomatic ST changes ( greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation ) were common : six of 25 patients ( 24 % ) had ST changes before 5 - FU infusion v 17 ( 68 % ) during 5 - FU infusion ( P less than . 002 ) .
2466960	6	838	The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0 . 05 + / - 0 . 02 prior to 5 - FU infusion v 0 . 13 + / - 0 . 03 during 5 - FU infusion ( P less than . 001 ) ; the duration of ECG changes was 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 3 minutes per patient per hour before 5 - FU v 1 . 9 + / - 0 . 5 minutes per patient per hour during 5 - FU ( P less than . 01 ) .
2466960	7	1151	ECG changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery disease .
2466960	8	1231	There were two cases of sudden death , both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course .
2466960	9	1331	We conclude that 5 - FU infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of ischemia , particularly among patients with coronary artery disease .
2466960	10	1517	The mechanism and clinical significance of these ECG changes remain to be determined .
2528969	0	0	Nature , time course and dose dependence of zidovudine - related side effects : results from the Multicenter Canadian Azidothymidine Trial .
2528969	1	136	To characterize the nature , time course and dose dependency of zidovudine - related side effects , we undertook a multicenter , prospective , dose - range finding study .
2528969	2	299	Our study group consisted of 74 HIV - positive homosexual men belonging to groups II B , III and IV C2 from the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) classification of HIV disease .
2528969	3	473	Following a 3 - week observation period , volunteers were treated with zidovudine 600 mg / day for 18 weeks , 900 mg / day for 9 weeks and 1200 mg / day for 9 weeks , followed by a washout period of 6 weeks after which they were re - started on 1200 mg / day or the highest tolerated dose at 8 - hourly intervals .
2528969	4	770	Subjects were randomly assigned to 4 - hourly or 8 - hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg / day .
2528969	5	887	Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3 - week intervals .
2528969	6	959	Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96 % of subjects , most commonly nausea ( 64 % ) , fatigue ( 55 % ) and headache ( 49 % ) .
2528969	7	1082	These were generally self - limited , reappearing briefly at each dose increment .
2528969	8	1161	A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy .
2528969	9	1232	This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment .
2528969	10	1316	A red blood cell count decrease , a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose - independent fashion , reverting at least partially during the washout phase .
2528969	11	1512	The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg / day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg / day .
2528969	12	1658	Bone marrow changes occurred rapidly as demonstrated by megaloblastosis in 95 % of 65 specimens at week 18 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
2533791	0	0	National project on the prevention of mother - to - infant infection by hepatitis B virus in Japan .
2533791	1	96	In Japan , a nationwide prevention program against mother - to - infant infection by hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) started in 1985 .
2533791	2	217	This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) and hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) positive mothers .
2533791	3	421	These infants are treated with two injections of hepatitis B immune globulin ( HBIG ) and at least three injections of plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine .
2533791	4	574	We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987 . 93 . 4 % pregnant women had the chance to be examined for HBsAg , and the positive rate was 1 . 4 to 1 . 5 % .
2533791	5	835	The HBeAg positive rate in HBsAg positive was 23 to 26 % .
2533791	6	892	The HBsAg positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3 % and 2 % respectively .
2533791	7	990	Some problems may arise , because 27 to 30 % of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas .
2557556	0	0	Involvement of the mu - opiate receptor in peripheral analgesia .
2557556	1	63	The intradermal injection of mu ( morphine , Tyr - D - Ala - Gly - NMe - Phe - Gly - ol and morphiceptin ) , kappa ( trans - 3 , 4 - dichloro - N - methyl - N [ 2 - ( 1 - pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexyl ] benzeneactemide ) and delta ( [ D - Pen2 . 5 ] - enkephalin and [ D - Ser2 ] - [ Leu ] enkephalin - Thr ) selective opioid - agonists , by themselves , did not significantly affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the hindpaw of the rat .
2557556	2	440	Intradermal injection of mu , but not delta or kappa opioid - agonists , however , produced dose - dependent inhibition of prostaglandin E2 - induced hyperalgesia .
2557556	3	595	The analgesic effect of the mu - agonist morphine was dose - dependently antagonized by naloxone and prevented by co - injection of pertussis toxin .
2557556	4	738	Morphine did not , however , alter the hyperalgesia induced by 8 - bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate .
2557556	5	839	We conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu - opioid receptor and that this action is mediated by inhibition of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate second messenger system .
2564649	0	0	Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl - induced muscular rigidity in the rat .
2564649	1	117	Whereas muscular rigidity is a well - known side effect that is associated with high - dose fentanyl anesthesia , a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism ( s ) .
2564649	2	302	We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon , using male Sprague - Dawley rats anesthetized with ketamine .
2564649	3	466	Under proper control of respiration , body temperature and end - tidal CO2 , intravenous administration of fentanyl ( 50 or 100 micrograms / kg ) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles .
2564649	4	730	Such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha - adrenoceptor blocker , prazosin .
2564649	5	948	Microinjection of fentanyl ( 2 . 5 micrograms / 50 nl ) directly into this pontine nucleus , on the other hand , elicited discernible electromyographic excitation .
2564649	6	1104	It is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons .
2569282	0	0	Dexmedetomidine , acting through central alpha - 2 adrenoceptors , prevents opiate - induced muscle rigidity in the rat .
2569282	1	115	The highly - selective alpha - 2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine ( D - MED ) is capable of inducing muscle flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs .
2569282	2	261	Intense generalized muscle rigidity is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists .
2569282	3	354	Although the neurochemistry of opiate - induced rigidity has yet to be fully elucidated , recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism .
2569282	4	505	In the present study , the authors determined if treatment with D - MED prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high - dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat .
2569282	5	657	Animals ( n = 42 ) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens : 1 ) L - MED ( the inactive L - isomer of medetomidine ) , 30 micrograms / kg ; 2 ) D - MED , 10 micrograms / kg ; 3 ) D - MED , 30 micrograms / kg ; 4 ) D - MED [ 30 micrograms / kg ] and the central - acting alpha - 2 antagonist , idazoxan [ 10 mg / kg ] ; 5 ) D - MED [ 30 micrograms / kg ] and the peripheral - acting alpha - 2 antagonist DG - 5128 [ 10 mg / kg ] , or ; 6 ) saline .
2569282	6	1069	Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment .
2569282	7	1181	Each rat was then injected with alfentanil ( ALF , 0 . 5 mg / kg sc ) .
2569282	8	1245	ALF injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L - MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline .
2569282	9	1418	In contrast , D - MED prevented alfentanil - induced muscle rigidity in a dose - dependent fashion .
2569282	10	1511	The small EMG values obtained in the high - dose D - MED group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate .
2569282	11	1668	The high - dose D - MED animals were flaccid , akinetic , and lacked a startle response during the entire experimental period . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
2576810	0	0	Some central effects of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine .
2576810	1	61	We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine , a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor , on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and methoxamine and on the animal behavior in the " behavioral despair " test .
2576810	2	287	A repeated treatment with fluvoxamine ( twice daily for 14 days ) potentiated in mice and in rats ( weaker ) the amphetamine - induced hyperactivity .
2576810	3	431	The hyperactivity induced by nomifensine in mice remained unaffected by fluvoxamine .
2576810	4	516	The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered methoxamine was not affected by repeated treatment with fluvoxamine .
2576810	5	665	Given three times fluvoxamine had no effect on the immobilization time in the " behavioral despair " test in rats .
2576810	6	778	The results indicate that fluvoxamine given repeatedly acts differently than citalopram , another selective serotonin uptake inhibitor , and differs also from other antidepressant drugs .
2594614	0	0	Protective effect of a specific platelet - activating factor antagonist , BN 52021 , on bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular impairments in rats .
2594614	1	140	Administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine ( 1 . 5 or 2 mg / kg , i . v . ) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial blood pressure ( MBP ) and heart rate ( HR ) leading to death ( in 67 % or 90 % of animals respectively ) .
2594614	2	366	Intravenous injection of the specific platelet - activating factor ( PAF ) antagonist BN 52021 ( 10 mg / kg ) , 30 min before bupivacaine administration ( 2 mg / kg i . v . ) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR .
2594614	3	569	In contrast , doses of 1 mg / kg BN 52021 given 30 min before or 10 mg / kg administered 5 min before i . v . injection of bupivacaine were ineffective .
2594614	4	714	When BN 52021 ( 20 mg / kg i . v . ) was injected immediately after bupivacaine ( 2 mg / kg ) , a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed , whereas the dose of 10 mg / kg was ineffective .
2594614	5	908	A partial recovery of bupivacaine - induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with BN 52021 .
2594614	6	1025	Since the administration of BN 52021 , at all doses studied , did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used , the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of BN 52021 , a specific antagonist of PAF , against bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular toxicity .
2594614	7	1291	Thus , consistent with its direct effect on heart , PAF appears to be implicated in bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular alterations .
2598570	0	0	The epidemiology of the acute flank pain syndrome from suprofen .
2598570	1	65	Suprofen , a new nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent .
2598570	2	168	Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system , 700 , 000 persons used the drug in the United States .
2598570	3	327	Through August 1986 , a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported .
2598570	4	401	To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome , a case - control study was performed , comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 suprofen - exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome .
2598570	5	648	Case patients were more likely to be men ( odds ratio , 3 . 8 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 2 - 12 . 1 ) , suffer from hay fever and asthma ( odds ratio , 3 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 0 - 11 . 9 ) ; to participate in regular exercise ( odds ratio , 5 . 9 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1 - 30 . 7 ) , especially in the use of Nautilus equipment ( p = 0 . 02 ) ; and to use alcohol ( odds ratio , 4 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1 - 17 . 5 ) .
2598570	6	1048	Possible risk factors included young age , concurrent use of other analgesic agents ( especially ibuprofen ) , preexisting renal disease , a history of kidney stones , a history of gout , a recent increase in activity , a recent increase in sun exposure , and residence in the Sunbelt .
2598570	7	1325	These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance .
2598570	8	1423	These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome : acute diffuse crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules .
2709684	0	0	Phlorizin - induced glycosuria does not prevent gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats .
2709684	1	81	Because rats with streptozotocin - induced diabetes mellitus ( DM ) have a high solute diuresis ( glycosuria of 10 to 12 g / day ) , we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to gentamicin - induced acute renal failure ( ARF ) .
2709684	2	330	The protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity was studied in non - diabetic rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular glucose reabsorption with phlorizin ( P ) .
2709684	3	510	DM rats with mild glycosuria ( similar in degree to that of the P treated animals ) were also studied .
2709684	4	611	Unanesthetized adult female , Sprague - Dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days .
2709684	5	713	Group 1 ( P alone ) received P , 360 mg / day , for 15 days ; Group II ( P + gentamicin ) ; Group III ( gentamicin alone ) and Group IV ( mild DM + gentamicin ) .
2709684	6	861	Nephrotoxic doses ( 40 mg / kg body wt / day ) of gentamicin were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV .
2709684	7	1000	In Group I , P induced a moderate and stable glycosuria ( 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 g / day , SE ) , and no functional or morphologic evidence of renal dysfunction ( baseline CCr 2 . 1 + / - 0 . 1 ml / min , undetectable lysozymuria ) or damage ( tubular necrosis score [ maximum 4 ] , zero ) .
2709684	8	1257	In Group II , P did not prevent gentamicin - ARF ( maximal decrease in CCr at day 9 . 89 % , P less than 0 . 001 ; peak lysozymuria , 1863 + / - 321 micrograms / day ; and tubular necrosis score , 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 ) .
2709684	9	1450	These values were not different from those of Group III : maximal decrease in CCr 73 % ( P less than 0 . 001 ) ; lysozymuria , 2147 + / - 701 micrograms / day ; tubular necrosis score , 3 . 8 + / - 0 . 1 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
2716967	0	0	Catalepsy induced by combinations of ketamine and morphine : potentiation , antagonism , tolerance and cross - tolerance in the rat .
2716967	1	128	Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat .
2716967	2	234	Pre - treatment with ketamine produced cross - tolerance to morphine , whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross - tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response ; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain .
2716967	3	492	The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub - effective doses of ketamine and morphine , administered simultaneously .
2716967	4	651	There was mutual potentiation between sub - effective doses of ketamine and morphine , but sub - effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully - effective doses of morphine .
2716967	5	825	Latency to the loss of righting reflex , rigidity and behavior on recovery , reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination .
2716967	6	981	Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects .
2716967	7	1032	The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub - effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar .
2716967	8	1185	Rats , tolerant to ketamine - dominant combinations , were cross - tolerant to both drugs , while those tolerant to morphine - dominant combinations were cross - tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross - tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine .
2716967	9	1432	While the mutual potentiation , antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy , differences in latency , rigidity and behavior , asymmetry of cross - tolerance and a widely - different ID50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site .
2722224	0	0	Hydrocortisone - induced hypertension in humans : pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function .
2722224	1	96	Oral hydrocortisone increases blood pressure and enhances pressor responsiveness in normal human subjects .
2722224	2	203	We studied the effects of 1 week of oral hydrocortisone ( 200 mg / day ) on blood pressure , cardiac output , total peripheral resistance , forearm vascular resistance , and norepinephrine spillover to plasma in eight healthy male volunteers .
2722224	3	438	Although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged , systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm Hg ( SED + / - 3 . 4 , p less than 0 . 01 ) , associated with an increased cardiac output ( 5 . 85 - 7 . 73 l / min , SED + / - 0 . 46 , p less than 0 . 01 ) .
2722224	4	676	Total peripheral vascular resistance fell from 15 . 1 to 12 . 2 mm Hg / l / min ( SED + / - 1 . 03 , p less than 0 . 05 ) .
2722224	5	782	Resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged , but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated , the rise in resistance increasing from 10 . 5 mm Hg / ml / 100 ml / min ( R units ) before treatment to 32 . 6 R units after treatment ( SED + / - 6 . 4 , p less than 0 . 025 ) .
2722224	6	1061	The rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra - arterial norepinephrine ( 25 , 50 , and 100 ng / min ) was also significantly greater after hydrocortisone , increasing from an average of 14 . 9 + / - 2 . 4 R units before treatment to 35 . 1 + / - 5 . 5 R units after hydrocortisone ( SED + / - 6 . 0 , p less than 0 . 05 ) .
2722224	7	1368	A shift to the left in the dose - response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after treatment .
2722224	8	1507	Measurement of resting norepinephrine spillover rate to plasma and norepinephrine uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased .
2722224	9	1682	The rise in resting blood pressure with hydrocortisone is associated with an increased cardiac output ( presumably due to increased blood volume ) . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
2750819	0	0	Neuromuscular blockade with magnesium sulfate and nifedipine .
2750819	1	62	A patient who received tocolysis with nifedipine developed neuromuscular blockade after 500 mg of magnesium sulfate was administered .
2750819	2	196	This reaction demonstrates that nifedipine can seriously potentiate the toxicity of magnesium .
2750819	3	291	Caution should be exercised when these two tocolytics are combined .
2790457	0	0	Chronic carbamazepine inhibits the development of local anesthetic seizures kindled by cocaine and lidocaine .
2790457	1	110	The effects of carbamazepine ( CBZ ) treatment on local anesthetic - kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of CBZ administration .
2790457	2	316	Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine - and cocaine - induced seizures , but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures .
2790457	3	480	Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure - related mortality in the cocaine - injected rats .
2790457	4	580	Acute CBZ over a range of doses ( 15 - 50 mg / kg ) had no effect on completed lidocaine - kindled or acute cocaine - induced seizures .
2790457	5	706	Repeated i . p . injection of CBZ ( 15 mg / kg ) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine - or cocaine - kindled seizures .
2790457	6	834	The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic - kindled seizures .
2790457	7	1025	The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated , intermittent injections of CBZ suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens .
2790457	8	1198	The possible utility of chronic CBZ in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data , but remains to be directly evaluated .
2819587	0	0	Magnetic resonance imaging of cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to " low - dose " birth control pills .
2819587	1	102	The clinical and radiographic features of cerebral deep venous thrombosis in a 21 - year - old white woman are presented .
2819587	2	220	This nulliparous patient presented with relatively mild clinical symptoms and progressing mental status changes .
2819587	3	333	The only known risk factor was " low - dose " oral contraceptive pills .
2819587	4	401	The magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) showed increased signal intensity from the internal cerebral veins , vein of Galen , and straight sinus .
2819587	5	539	The diagnosis was confirmed by arterial angiography .
2826064	0	0	Beta - 2 - adrenoceptor - mediated hypokalemia and its abolishment by oxprenolol .
2826064	1	76	The time course and concentration - effect relationship of terbutaline - induced hypokalemia was studied , using computer - aided pharmacokinetic - dynamic modeling .
2826064	2	233	Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such hypokalemia , together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs .
2826064	3	389	Six healthy subjects were given a 0 . 5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions : 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg oxprenolol orally .
2826064	4	569	In the 7 - hour period after terbutaline administration , plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma potassium levels and drug concentrations .
2826064	5	720	The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and potassium effects .
2826064	6	844	Oxprenolol caused decreases of 65 % and 56 % of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance , respectively , and an increase of 130 % of its AUC .
2826064	7	990	In spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after oxprenolol pretreatment , the hypokalemia was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2 - blocking action .
2840807	0	0	A dystonia - like syndrome after neuropeptide ( MSH / ACTH ) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus .
2840807	1	94	The movement disorder investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic dystonia , and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit .
2840807	2	286	The present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the LC resulted in a NE - mediated inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo - cerebellar pathway .
2840807	3	490	However , it is not certain as to the following : ( a ) what receptors were stimulated by the ACTH N - terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder ; ( b ) whether NE , released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo - cerebellar pathway , did indeed cause the long - term depression at Purkinje cell synapses ( previously described by others ) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder ; ( c ) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei , the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons , that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder .
2840807	4	1207	These questions are currently being investigated .
2886572	0	0	Enhanced stimulus - induced neurotransmitter overflow in epinephrine - induced hypertensive rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta - adrenoceptor activation .
2886572	1	156	The present study examines the effect of 6 - day epinephrine treatment ( 100 micrograms / kg per h , s . c . ) on stimulus - induced ( 1 Hz ) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle - and epinephrine - treated rats .
2886572	2	397	Renal catecholamine stores and stimulus - induced overflow in the vehicle - treated group consisted of norepinephrine only .
2886572	3	517	However , epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40 % of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was reduced by a similar degree .
2886572	4	764	Total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged .
2886572	5	845	Stimulus - induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine - treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidney .
2886572	6	1076	This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade .
2886572	7	1194	Propranolol had no effect on stimulus - induced overflow in either group .
2886572	8	1266	Phentolamine increased stimulus - induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine - treated group .
2886572	9	1411	In conclusion , chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow .
2886572	10	1514	However , neither alterations in prejunctional beta - adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration .
2886572	11	1699	Furthermore , data obtained with phentolamine alone do not suggest alpha - adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment .
2893236	0	0	GABA involvement in naloxone induced reversal of respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental .
2893236	1	95	No agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by CNS depressants , such as general anesthetics .
2893236	2	212	In this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats . 25 mg / kg , i . v . thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate , increased GABA , decreased glutamate , and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem .
2893236	3	515	Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental . 50 mg / kg , i . v . thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain .
2893236	4	886	Naloxone ( 2 . 5 mg / kg , i . v . ) reversed respiratory paralysis , glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum .
2893236	5	1056	These data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves GABA in its action .
2894433	0	0	Diazepam facilitates reflex bradycardia in conscious rats .
2894433	1	59	The effects of diazepam on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats .
2894433	2	143	Intravenous administration of diazepam ( 1 - 30 mg kg - 1 ) produced a dose - dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate .
2894433	3	287	Also , reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline ( 1 . 25 - 2 . 5 micrograms kg - 1 ) .
2894433	4	399	Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam , although causing no change in the adrenaline - induced pressor effect , did enhance the adrenaline - induced reflex bradycardia .
2894433	5	575	However , the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline - induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picrotoxin ( an agent blocks chloride channels by binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine - GABA - chloride channel macromolecular complex ) .
2894433	6	866	The data indicate that diazepam acts through the benzodiazepine - GABA - chloride channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex bradycardia mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure .
28952	0	0	Initial potassium loss and hypokalaemia during chlorthalidone administration in patients with essential hypertension : the influence of dietary sodium restriction .
28952	1	163	To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic , metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment .
28952	2	433	Chlorthalidone ( 50 mg daily ) was given for 14 days .
28952	3	485	Six patients received a normal - sodium diet and four a low - sodium ( 17 mmol / day ) diet .
28952	4	570	All patients had a normal initial total body potassium ( 40K ) .
28952	5	632	The electrolyte balances , weight , bromide space , plasma renin activity , and aldosterone secretion rate were measured .
28952	6	750	In both groups a potassium deficit developed , with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment .
28952	7	894	In the normal - sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9 , after which some potassium was regained ; in the low - sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13 .
28952	8	1088	The normal - sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels ; in the low - sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elevated .
28952	9	1279	It is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic - induced potassium loss , presumably by an increased activity of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion .
2907585	0	0	Reversal of neuroleptic - induced catalepsy by novel aryl - piperazine anxiolytic drugs .
2907585	1	85	The novel anxiolytic drug , buspirone , reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol .
2907585	2	166	A series of aryl - piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5 - hydroxytryptaminergic agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy .
2907585	3	332	Those drugs with strong affinity for 5 - hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy .
2907585	4	433	Drugs with affinity for other 5 - HT receptors or weak affinity were ineffective .
2907585	5	513	However , inhibition of postsynaptic 5 - HT receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect .
2917114	0	0	Glycopyrronium requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of edrophonium .
2917114	1	90	We have compared , in 60 adult patients , the cardiovascular effects of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg - 1 and 10 micrograms kg - 1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before edrophonium 1 mg kg - 1 .
2917114	2	283	Significant differences between the four groups were detected ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
2917114	3	366	Both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg - 1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min - 1 ( 95 % confidence limits 28 - 32 beat min - 1 ) .
2917114	4	503	Use of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg - 1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and , given 1 min before the edrophonium , was sufficient to minimize early , edrophonium - induced bradycardias .
2917114	5	694	This low dose of glycopyrronium provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions .
2980315	0	0	Selective injection of iopentol , iohexol and metrizoate into the left coronary artery of the dog .
2980315	1	98	Induction of ventricular fibrillation and decrease of aortic pressure .
2980315	2	169	In twenty beagle dogs selective injections were made into the left coronary artery with iopentol , iohexol and metrizoate in doses of 4 ml , 8 ml and 16 ml .
2980315	3	324	Thirty - six iopentol injections , 35 iohexol injections and 37 metrizoate injections were made .
2980315	4	418	Frequencies of ventricular fibrillation were significantly lower ( p less than 0 . 05 ) after iopentol ( 0 % ) and iohexol ( 3 % ) than after metrizoate ( 22 % ) .
2980315	5	568	Iopentol and iohexol also produced significantly less decrease in aortic blood pressure than metrizoate at the different doses .
3001299	0	0	Thyroid function and urine - concentrating ability during lithium treatment .
3001299	1	75	It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism during lithium treatment .
3001299	2	251	We measured serum thyroxine and urine - concentrating ability ( Umax ) in response to desmopressin ( DDAVP ) in 85 patients receiving lithium .
3001299	3	388	Hypothyroidism developed in eight patients while they were taking lithium .
3001299	4	463	Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and hypothyroid patients while some hypothyroid patients concentrated their urine well .
3001299	5	593	It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which lithium exerts these two effects are different .
3015327	0	0	Remodelling of nerve structure in experimental isoniazid neuropathy in the rat .
3015327	1	80	The neuropathy caused by a single dose of isoniazid in rats was studied with a computer - assisted morphometric method .
3015327	2	198	Scatter diagrams of the g ratio ( quotient fibre diameter / axon diameter ) define regenerating fibres as a distinct population , distinguishable from the surviving fibres by reduced sheath thickness and reduced axon calibre .
3015327	3	419	There was also evidence of a subtle direct toxic effect on the entire fibre population , causing axon shrinkage masked by readjustment of the myelin sheath .
3057041	0	0	Multicenter , double - blind , multiple - dose , parallel - groups efficacy and safety trial of azelastine , chlorpheniramine , and placebo in the treatment of spring allergic rhinitis .
3057041	1	175	Azelastine , a novel antiallergic medication , was compared with chlorpheniramine maleate and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of spring allergic rhinitis in a multicenter , double - blind , multiple - dose , parallel - groups study .
3057041	2	414	One hundred fifty - five subjects participated .
3057041	3	460	Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2 - year history of spring allergic rhinitis , confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens .
3057041	4	630	Medications were given four times daily ; the azelastine groups received 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , or 2 . 0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon ; the chlorpheniramine group received 4 . 0 mg four times daily .
3057041	5	856	Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4 - week treatment period while subjects received study medications .
3057041	6	1037	Individual symptoms , total symptoms , and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication .
3057041	7	1144	Elicited , volunteered , and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups .
3057041	8	1258	Vital signs , body weights , serum chemistry values , complete blood cell counts , urine studies , and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups .
3057041	9	1433	Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of azelastine ( 2 . 0 mg twice daily ) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study .
3057041	10	1616	Lower doses of azelastine were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study .
3057041	11	1745	In contrast , although the chlorpheniramine group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study , the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the study .
3057041	12	1943	There were no serious side effects in any of the treatment groups .
3057041	13	2010	Drowsiness and altered taste perception were increased significantly over placebo only in the high - dose azelastine group .
3057041	14	2132	Azelastine appears to be a safe , efficacious medication for seasonal allergic rhinitis .
3084782	0	0	Toxicity due to remission inducing drugs in rheumatoid arthritis .
3084782	1	66	Association with HLA - B35 and Cw4 antigens .
3084782	2	109	Twenty - five patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) who developed toxicity while taking remission inducing drugs and 30 without toxicity were studied for possible associations with class I and II HLA antigens .
3084782	3	319	A strong association has been found between nephritis and dermatitis due to Tiopronin ( a D - Penicillamine like compound ) and class I antigens B35 - Cw4 , and between dermatitis due to gold thiosulphate and B35 .
3084782	4	526	Compared to healthy controls a lower DR5 frequency was observed in patients with RA except for the Tiopronin related nephritis group .
3088349	0	0	Transient contralateral rotation following unilateral substantia nigra lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amphetamine .
3088349	1	160	Following unilateral 6 - OHDA induced SN lesion , a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling .
3088349	2	319	In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion , on amphetamine - induced rotational behavior .
3088349	3	509	Three days post lesion , most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion .
3088349	4	596	Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration - induced breakdown of the DA pool , or lesion - induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons .
3088349	5	759	A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning , indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation .
3088349	6	974	However , regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume , amphetamine dose , or post - lesion motor exercise ) , amphetamine - induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed , and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections .
3088349	7	1323	These findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post - lesion DA pool contributing to contralateral rotation .
3108839	0	0	Mitomycin C associated hemolytic uremic syndrome .
3108839	1	50	Mitomycin C associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome ( HUS ) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised .
3108839	2	186	It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin C treatment and affects about 10 % of patients treated with this agent .
3108839	3	380	The renal failure usually develops about 8 - 10 mth after start of mitomycin C treatment and the mortality is approximately 60 % from renal failure or pulmonary edema .
3108839	4	545	Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi , expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls , ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis .
3108839	5	774	The mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin C - induced endothelial cell damage .
3108839	6	860	We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr - old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with mitomycin C and died in pulmonary edema .
3115150	0	0	Ketanserin pretreatment reverses alfentanil - induced muscle rigidity .
3115150	1	69	Systemic pretreatment with ketanserin , a relatively specific type - 2 serotonin receptor antagonist , significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short - acting opiate agonist alfentanil .
3115150	2	284	Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal ' s left gastrocnemius muscle , rigidity was assessed by analyzing root - mean - square electromyographic activity .
3115150	3	455	Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0 . 63 and 2 . 5 mg / kg prevented the alfentanil - induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline .
3115150	4	646	Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg / kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil .
3115150	5	758	Despite the absence of rigidity , animals that received ketanserin ( greater than 0 . 31 mg / kg i . p . ) followed by alfentanil were motionless , flaccid , and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone .
3115150	6	990	Rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60 - min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone .
3115150	7	1174	These results , in combination with previous work , suggest that muscle rigidity , a clinically relevant side - effect of parenteral narcotic administration , may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways .
3115150	8	1377	Pretreatment with type - 2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate - induced rigidity , although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS , cardiovascular , and respiratory depression .
3120485	0	0	Antagonism of diazepam - induced sedative effects by Ro15 - 1788 in patients after surgery under lumbar epidural block .
3120485	1	116	A double - blind placebo - controlled investigation of efficacy and safety .
3120485	2	188	The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Ro15 - 1788 and a placebo in reversing diazepam - induced effects after surgery under epidural block , and to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of Ro15 - 1788 .
3120485	3	407	Fifty - seven patients were sedated with diazepam for surgery under epidural anaesthesia .
3120485	4	495	Antagonism of diazepam - induced effects by Ro15 - 1788 was investigated postoperatively in a double - blind placebo - controlled trial .
3120485	5	624	The patient ' s subjective assessment of mood rating , an objective test of performance , a test for amnesia , and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min after administration of the trial drug .
3120485	6	818	No significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating , amnesia , or vital signs .
3120485	7	924	The Ro15 - 1788 group showed a significant improvement in the performance test up to 120 min after administration of the drug .
3120485	8	1049	There was no evidence of reaction at the injection site .
3123611	0	0	Chorea associated with oral contraception .
3123611	1	43	Three patients developed chorea while receiving oral contraceptives .
3123611	2	112	Two were young patients whose chorea developed long after treatment had been started and disappeared soon after it had been discontinued .
3123611	3	250	The third patient had acute amphetamine - induced chorea after prolonged oral contraception .
3123611	4	341	Prolonged administration of female sex hormones is a possible cause of chorea in women who have not previously had chorea or rheumatic fever .
3131282	0	0	Co - carcinogenic effect of retinyl acetate on forestomach carcinogenesis of male F344 rats induced with butylated hydroxyanisole .
3131282	1	129	The potential modifying effect of retinyl acetate ( RA ) on butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) - induced rat forestomach tumorigenesis was examined .
3131282	2	270	Male F344 rats , 5 weeks of age , were maintained on diet containing 1 % or 2 % BHA by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with RA at various concentrations ( w / v ) for 52 weeks .
3131282	3	464	In groups given 2 % BHA , although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals , co - administration of 0 . 25 % RA significantly ( P less than 0 . 05 ) increased the incidence of forestomach tumors ( squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma ) to 60 % ( 9 / 15 , 2 rats with carcinoma ) from 15 % ( 3 / 20 , one rat with carcinoma ) in the group given RA - free water .
3131282	4	845	In rats given 1 % BHA , RA co - administered at a dose of 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 or 0 . 25 % showed a dose - dependent enhancing effect on the development of the BHA - induced epithelial hyperplasia .
3131282	5	1026	Tumors , all papillomas , were induced in 3 rats ( 17 % ) with 0 . 25 % RA and in one rat ( 10 % ) with 0 . 05 % RA co - administration .
3131282	6	1147	RA alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach .
3131282	7	1212	These findings indicate that RA acted as a co - carcinogen in the BHA forestomach carcinogenesis of the rat .
3137399	0	0	A prospective study on the dose dependency of cardiotoxicity induced by mitomycin C .
3137399	1	85	Since 1975 mitomycin C ( MMC ) has been suggested to be cardiotoxic , especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin .
3137399	2	214	Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known .
3137399	3	295	We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects .
3137399	4	377	Forty - four MMC - treated patients were studied , 37 of them could be evaluated .
3137399	5	454	All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations , chest X - rays , electro - and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ) determinations .
3137399	6	632	The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level .
3137399	7	686	One of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m - 2 MMC and only 150 mg m - 2 doxorubicin .
3137399	8	785	The cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test .
3137399	9	874	None of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity , nor did the studied parameters change .
3137399	10	975	The literature on this subject was also reviewed .
3137399	11	1025	Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature , we suggest that MMC - related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent , occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m - 2 or more , mainly in patients also ( previously or simultaneously ) treated with doxorubicin .
3137399	12	1296	The incidence is likely to be less than 10 % even for this risk group .
3183120	0	0	Reversible cerebral lesions associated with tiazofurin usage : MR demonstration .
3183120	1	80	Tiazofurin is an experimental chemotherapeutic agent currently undergoing clinical evaluation .
3183120	2	175	We report our results with magnetic resonance ( MR ) in demonstrating reversible cerebral abnormalities concurrent with the use of this drug .
3183120	3	315	The abnormalities on MR were correlated with findings on CT as well as with cerebral angiography .
3183120	4	413	The utility of MR in the evaluation of patients receiving this new agent is illustrated .
3220106	0	0	Receptor mechanisms of nicotine - induced locomotor hyperactivity in chronic nicotine - treated rats .
3220106	1	98	Rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine ( 1 . 5 mg / kg per day ) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini - pump which continuously released saline or nicotine for 1 , 5 and 14 days .
3220106	2	305	At the end of each pretreatment period , animals were used for ( i ) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine ( 0 . 2 mg / kg , s . c . ) and ( ii ) measuring the density of L - [ 3H ] nicotine and [ 3H ] spiperone binding sites in the striatum .
3220106	3	553	We observed no changes in nicotine - induced locomotor response , striatal L - [ 3H ] nicotine and [ 3H ] spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day .
3220106	4	717	In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days , there was a significant increase in the nicotine - stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L - [ 3H ] nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine ( DA ) level in the striatum .
3220106	5	999	The number of striatal [ 3H ] spiperone binding sites was not affected .
3220106	6	1068	In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days , the nicotine - induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated .
3220106	7	1185	However , this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [ 3H ] spiperone binding sites , whereas the number of striatal L - [ 3H ] nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal .
3220106	8	1387	These results suggest that chronic nicotine - treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and DA concentration , followed by inducing DA receptor supersensitivity in the striatum .
326460	0	0	Amelioration of bendrofluazide - induced hypokalemia by timolol .
326460	1	63	The beta adrenergic blocking drug , timolol , tended to correct the hypokalemia of short - term bendrofluazide treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was significant .
326460	2	261	Timolol also reduced the rise in plasma aldosterone and urine potassium excretion following bendrofluazide and increased the urine sodium / potassium ratio .
326460	3	416	There was no evidence of a shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space .
3300918	0	0	St . Anthony ' s fire , then and now : a case report and historical review .
3300918	1	71	A rare case of morbid vasospasm , together with striking angiographic findings , is described secondary to the ingestion of methysergide by a 48 - year - old woman .
3300918	2	230	A brief review of the literature on similar cases is presented .
3300918	3	294	A discussion of the history of ergot includes its original discovery , the epidemics of gangrene that it has caused through the ages and its past and present role in the management of migraine headache .
3300918	4	496	Despite the advent of calcium channel blockers and beta - adrenergic antagonists , ergot preparations continue to play a major role in migraine therapy , so that the danger of St . Anthony ' s fire persists .
3311455	0	0	Cardiac transplantation : improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol .
3311455	1	98	The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients .
3311455	2	261	In group I , cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17 . 5 mg / kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng / ml .
3311455	3	434	In group II , cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine , which was used for the first postoperative week .
3311455	4	602	Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels .
3311455	5	728	Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long - term therapy with cyclosporine .
3311455	6	848	Despite this improvement in late renal function , group II still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine .
3311455	7	951	We think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect .
33969	0	0	Ethopropazine and benztropine in neuroleptic - induced parkinsonism .
33969	1	67	In a 12 - week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients .
33969	2	239	Ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine , their previous antiparkinsonian drug .
33969	3	420	However , benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment , and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients .
33969	4	650	This suggests that benztropine is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic - induced parkinsonian symptoms , because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect .
3411101	0	0	Quinidine phenylethylbarbiturate - induced fulminant hepatitis in a pregnant woman .
3411101	1	82	A case report .
3411101	2	97	We report the case of a 19 - year - old Laotian patient affected by fulminant hepatitis during the third trimester of her pregnancy after a 1 - month administration of quinidine phenylethylbarbiturate .
3411101	3	293	After delivery , the patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation .
3411101	4	365	The patient was in good condition 16 months after liver transplantation .
3411101	5	438	Quinidine itself or phenylethylbarbiturate may be responsible for fulminant hepatitis in this patient .
3413271	0	0	Mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine : comparison with exercise - induced ischemia .
3413271	1	101	The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease .
3413271	2	213	Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise .
3413271	3	365	Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina .
3413271	4	474	However , the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise .
3413271	5	597	Exercise - induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate - pressure product with a minor contribution of end - diastolic volume , while epinephrine - induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate - pressure product .
3413271	6	923	These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine , as may occur during states of emotional distress , has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion .
3431591	0	0	Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor N10 - propargyl - 5 , 8 - dideazafolic acid ( CB 3717 ) .
3431591	1	127	CB 3717 , N10 - propargyl - 5 , 8 - dideazafolic acid , is a tight - binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme .
3431591	2	308	Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of CB 3717 polyglutamates .
3431591	3	406	Following a 12 - hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [ 3H ] CB 3717 , 30 % of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as CB 3717 tetra - and pentaglutamate , as determined by high - pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analyses .
3431591	4	644	As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS , CB 3717 di - , tri - , tetra - and pentaglutamate are 26 - , 87 - , 119 - and 114 - fold more potent than CB 3717 , respectively , and their formation may , therefore , be an important determinant of CB 3717 cytotoxicity .
3431591	5	886	In early clinical studies with CB 3717 , activity has been seen in breast cancer , ovarian cancer , hepatoma , and mesothelioma .
3431591	6	1011	Toxicities included hepatotoxicity , malaise , and dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .
3431591	7	1090	This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of CB 3717 under acidic conditions .
3431591	8	1247	In an attempt to overcome this problem , a clinical trial of CB 3717 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way .
3431591	9	1365	Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg / m2 suggest that a reduction in nephrotoxicity may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients .
3431591	10	1527	Hepatotoxicity and malaise are again the most frequent side effects .
3431591	11	1596	Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients .
3431591	12	1656	Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter CB 3717 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved .
343678	0	0	Type B hepatitis after needle - stick exposure : prevention with hepatitis B immune globulin .
343678	1	91	Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study .
343678	2	154	Hepatitis B immune globulin ( HBIG ) and immune serum globulin ( ISG ) were examined in a randomized , double - blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing type B hepatitis after needle - stick exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAG ) - positive donors .
343678	3	422	Clinical hepatitis developed in 1 . 4 % of HBIG and in 5 . 9 % of ISG recipients ( P = 0 . 016 ) , and seroconversion ( anti - HBs ) occurred in 5 . 6 % and 20 . 7 % of them respectively ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
343678	4	609	Mild and transient side - effects were noted in 3 . 0 % of ISG and in 3 . 2 % of HBIG recipients .
343678	5	699	Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase ( DNAP ) and e antigen and antibody ( HBeAg ; anti - HBE ) .
343678	6	806	Both DNAP and HBeAg showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of HBsAg - positive donors .
343678	7	927	Hepatitis B immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing type B hepatitis even when the analysis was confined to these two high - risk subgroups .
343678	8	1095	The efficacy of ISG in preventing type B hepatitis cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included .
3461217	0	0	Production of autochthonous prostate cancer in Lobund - Wistar rats by treatments with N - nitroso - N - methylurea and testosterone .
3461217	1	126	More than 50 % of Lobund - Wistar ( L - W ) strain rats developed large , palpable prostate adenocarcinomas ( PAs ) following treatments with N - nitroso - N - methylurea ( CAS : 684 - 93 - 5 ) and testosterone propionate [ ( TP ) CAS : 57 - 85 - 2 ] , and most of the tumor - bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions .
3461217	2	412	The incubation periods averaged 10 . 6 months .
3461217	3	457	Within the same timeframe , no L - W rat developed a similar palpable PA when treated only with TP .
3461217	4	554	In L - W rats , TP acted as a tumor enhancement agent , with primary emphasis on the development of prostate cancer .
3535719	0	0	Relative efficacy and toxicity of netilmicin and tobramycin in oncology patients .
3535719	1	82	We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with piperacillin sodium in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections .
3535719	2	283	The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious .
3535719	3	336	Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin ( 17 % vs 11 % ) .
3535719	4	449	Ototoxicity occurred in four ( 9 . 5 % ) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 ( 22 % ) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin - treated patients .
3535719	5	587	Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms , three of four netilmicin and piperacillin - treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin - treated patients .
3535719	6	809	The number of greater than or equal to 15 - dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15 - dB changes ( increases and decreases ) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin - vs tobramycin and piperacillin - treated patients ( 18 of 78 vs 67 of 115 ) .
3535719	7	1105	We conclude that aminoglycoside - associated ototoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with netilmicin than with tobramycin .
3653576	0	0	Urinary enzymes and protein patterns as indicators of injury to different regions of the kidney .
3653576	1	97	Acute experimental models of renal damage to the proximal tubular , glomerular , and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of hexachloro - 1 : 3 - butadiene ( HCBD ) , puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) , and 2 - bromoethylamine ( BEA ) , respectively .
3653576	2	353	Several routine indicators of nephrotoxicity , the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase , and the molecular weight of protein excretion were determined on urine samples .
3653576	3	547	Tubular damage produced by HCBD or BEA was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from glomerular damage produced by PAN .
3653576	4	682	The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in protein excretion , especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40 , 000 Da .
3653576	5	824	In contrast , protein excretion in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by excretion of proteins of a wide range of molecular weights .
3653576	6	979	Proximal tubular damage caused by HCBD and papillary damage caused by BEA were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis ( volume and specific gravity ) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes .
3653576	7	1181	Alkaline phosphatase and glucose were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage .
3653576	8	1364	It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of renal damage .
3670965	0	0	A catch in the Reye .
3670965	1	21	Twenty - six cases of Reye syndrome from The Children ' s Hospital , Camperdown , Australia , occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed .
3670965	2	155	Of these , 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of Reye syndrome .
3670965	3	280	Aspirin or salicylate ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases ( 5 % ) , and paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) had been administered in only six of the cases ( 30 % ) .
3670965	4	445	Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of Reye syndrome was accomplished in 90 % of the cases .
3670965	5	541	The incidence of Reye syndrome in New South Wales , Australia , is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain .
3670965	6	823	The mortality for these Reye syndrome cases in Australia was 45 % as compared with a 32 % case - fatality rate in the United States .
3670965	7	952	In Australia , the pediatric usage of aspirin has been extremely low for the past 25 years ( less than 1 % of total dosage units sold ) , with paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market .
3670965	8	1177	Reye syndrome may be disappearing from Australia despite a total lack of association with salicylates or aspirin ingestion , since there were no cases found at The Children ' s Hospital in 1983 , 1984 , or 1985 .
3686155	0	0	Postpartum psychosis induced by bromocriptine .
3686155	1	47	Two multigravida patients with no prior psychiatric history were seen with postpartum psychosis , having received bromocriptine for inhibition of lactation .
3686155	2	203	Bromocriptine given in high doses has been associated with psychosis in patients receiving the drug for Parkinson ' s disease .
3686155	3	328	These cases demonstrate that bromocriptine may cause psychosis even when given in low doses .
3703509	0	0	Hyperglycemic acidotic coma and death in Kearns - Sayre syndrome .
3703509	1	64	This paper presents the clinical and metabolic findings in two young boys with long - standing Kearns - Sayre syndrome .
3703509	2	180	Following short exposure to oral prednisone , both boys developed lethargy , increasing somnolence , polydipsia , polyphagia , and polyuria .
3703509	3	316	Both presented in the emergency room with profound coma , hypotension , severe hyperglycemia , and acidosis .
3703509	4	422	Nonketotic lactic acidosis was present in one and ketosis without a known serum lactate level was present in the other .
3703509	5	542	Respiratory failure rapidly ensued and both patients expired in spite of efforts at resuscitation .
3703509	6	641	We believe these two cases represent a newly described and catastrophic metabolic - endocrine failure in the Kearns - Sayre syndrome .
3708922	0	0	Experimental cyclosporine nephrotoxicity : risk of concomitant chemotherapy .
3708922	1	76	The role of cyclosporine ( CSA ) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rats .
3708922	2	222	Administration of 20 mg / kg / day CSA for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man .
3708922	3	350	The combined administration of CSA and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential , such as gentamicin ( at therapeutic doses ) , amphothericin B and ketoconazole , which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients , did not aggravate the CSA induced toxicity in the rat model .
3708922	4	644	Gentamicin at toxic doses , however , increased CSA nephrotoxicity .
3708922	5	710	Thus , the nephrotoxicity induced by CSA has a different pathogenetic mechanism .
3732088	0	0	Diuretics , potassium and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary disease .
3732088	1	71	It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias .
3732088	2	184	If this were so , patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible .
3732088	3	272	Thus , myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium - conserving diuretic ( amiloride ) and a similar period on a potassium - losing diuretic ( chlorthalidone ) in a randomised study .
3732088	4	573	Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol / L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy .
3732088	5	699	Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight , plasma renin and noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens .
3732088	6	854	Compared to amiloride treatment , the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats ( 24 - hour Holter monitoring ) and a higher Lown grading , increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential , prolonged ventricular effective refractory period , and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation .
3732088	7	1237	The above results indicate that because potassium - losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease , even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients .
3762968	0	0	Transketolase abnormality in tolazamide - induced Wernicke ' s encephalopathy .
3762968	1	75	We studied a thiamine - dependent enzyme , transketolase , from fibroblasts of a diabetic patient who developed Wernicke ' s encephalopathy when treated with tolazamide , in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [ high Km for thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP ) ] , as previously reported in postalcoholic Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome .
3762968	2	425	In addition to this patient , we also studied this enzyme from three diabetic kindreds without any history of Wernicke ' s encephalopathy and from four normal controls .
3762968	3	591	We found that the above - mentioned patient and one of the diabetic kindreds with no history of Wernicke ' s encephalopathy had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for TPP .
3762968	4	771	These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome and the patient with tolazamide - induced Wernicke ' s encephalopathy from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality .
3769769	0	0	Bradycardia due to trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride .
3769769	1	50	A chronic schizophrenic patient was treated with an anticholinergic drug , trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride .
3769769	2	155	The patient developed , paradoxically , sinus bradycardia .
3769769	3	212	The reaction was specific to trihexyphenidyl and not to other anticholinergic drugs .
3769769	4	297	This antidyskinetic drug is widely used in clinical psychiatric practice and physicians should be aware of this side effect .
3780697	0	0	Post - operative rigidity after fentanyl administration .
3780697	1	55	A case of thoraco - abdominal rigidity leading to respiratory failure is described in the post - operative period in an elderly patient who received a moderate dose of fentanyl .
3780697	2	229	This was successfully reversed by naloxone .
3780697	3	273	The mechanisms possibly implicated in this accident are discussed .
3780814	0	0	Anti - carcinogenic action of phenobarbital given simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine in the rat .
3780814	1	99	The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of phenobarbital ( PB : 15 mg per rat of ingested dose ) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine ( DEN : 10 mg / kg / day ) .
3780814	2	322	Wistar rats ( 180 g ) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2 , 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis .
3780814	3	459	After the end of the treatment , the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks .
3780814	4	645	The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + PB treated rats .
3780814	5	826	When the treatment last only 2 weeks , the presence of PB did not change significantly the last parameters .
3780814	6	933	In DEN + PB treated rats , the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone .
3780814	7	1072	It is concluded that PB , which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment , reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN .
3780814	8	1236	This ' anti - carcinogen ' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the precancerous lesions .
3780814	9	1346	Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this ' paradoxical ' PB effect .
384871	0	0	Bilateral optic neuropathy due to combined ethambutol and isoniazid treatment .
384871	1	79	The case of a 40 - year - old patient who underwent an unsuccessful cadaver kidney transplantation and was treated with ethambutol and isoniazid is reported .
384871	2	233	A bilateral retrobulbar neuropathy with an unusual central bitemporal hemianopic scotoma was found .
384871	3	333	Ethambutol was stopped and only small improvement of the visual acuity followed .
384871	4	414	Isoniazid was discontinued later , followed by a dramatic improvement in the visual acuity .
384871	5	505	The hazards of optic nerve toxicity due to ethambutol are known .
384871	6	570	We emphasize the potential danger in the use of ethambutol and isoniazid .
3934126	0	0	A prospective study of adverse reactions associated with vancomycin therapy .
3934126	1	77	A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vancomycin was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16 - month period .
3934126	2	208	Vancomycin was curative in 95 % of 43 patients with proven infection .
3934126	3	277	Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions ; in three of these vancomycin was considered the likely cause .
3934126	4	403	Reactions included thrombophlebitis ( 20 of 54 patients ) , rash ( 4 of 54 ) , nephrotoxicity ( 4 of 50 ) , proteinuria ( 1 of 50 ) and ototoxicity ( 1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry ) .
3934126	5	581	Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae ; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus vancomycin .
3934126	6	757	We conclude that vancomycin , administered appropriately , constitutes safe , effective therapy for infections caused by susceptible bacteria .
3950060	0	0	Factors associated with nephrotoxicity and clinical outcome in patients receiving amikacin .
3950060	1	92	Data from 60 patients treated with amikacin were analyzed for factors associated with nephrotoxicity .
3950060	2	194	In 42 of these patients , data were examined for factors associated with clinical outcome .
3950060	3	284	Variables evaluated included patient weight , age , sex , serum creatinine level , creatinine clearance , duration of therapy , total dose , mean daily dose , organism minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) , mean peak levels , mean trough levels , mean area under the serum concentration - time curve ( AUC ) , total AUC , mean AUC greater than MIC , total AUC greater than MIC , mean Schumacher ' s intensity factor ( IF ) , total IF , In ( mean maximum concentration [ Cmax ] / MIC ) .
3950060	4	741	Model - dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by computer based on a one - compartment model .
3950060	5	846	When the parameters were examined individually , duration of therapy and total AUC correlated significantly ( P less than . 05 ) with nephrotoxicity .
3950060	6	992	In contrast , a stepwise discriminant function analysis identified only duration of therapy ( P less than . 001 ) as an important factor .
3950060	7	1126	Based on this model and on Bayes ' theorem , the predictive accuracy of identifying " nephrotoxic " patients increased from 0 . 17 to 0 . 39 .
3950060	8	1260	When examined individually , mean IF , MIC , total dose , mean daily dose , and ln ( mean Cmax / MIC ) correlated significantly ( P less than . 05 ) with cure .
3950060	9	1408	In contrast , a simultaneous multivariable analysis identified IF , MIC , and total dose according to one model and ln ( mean Cmax / MIC ) according to a second statistical model of parameters selected to have the greatest prospective value .
3950060	10	1643	Based on Bayes ' theorem and the first model , the predictive accuracy of identifying patients not cured increased from 0 . 19 to 0 . 83 .
3950060	11	1775	For the second model , the predictive accuracy increased from 0 . 19 to 0 . 50 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
3952818	0	0	Cardiac toxicity of 5 - fluorouracil .
3952818	1	36	Report of a case of spontaneous angina .
3952818	2	76	We report a case of a patient with colon carcinoma and liver metastasis who presented chest pain after 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) administration .
3952818	3	217	Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in Prinzmetal ' s angina , and chest pain promptly resolved with nifedipine .
3952818	4	360	These data suggest that coronary spasm may be the cause of cardiotoxicity due to 5 - FU , and that calcium antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or treatment of 5 - FU cardiotoxicity .
3961813	0	0	Dose - related beneficial and adverse effects of dietary corticosterone on organophosphorus - induced delayed neuropathy in chickens .
3961813	1	130	Tri - ortho - tolyl phosphate ( TOTP ) , 360 mg / kg , po , and 0 , 0 ' - diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate ( DFP ) , 1 mg / kg sc , were administered to adult White Leghorn chickens 24 hr after they were placed on diets containing 0 to 300 ppm corticosterone .
3961813	2	367	Supplemented diets were continued until clinical signs and lesions of delayed neuropathy appeared .
3961813	3	466	Although low concentrations ( less than or equal to 50 ppm ) of corticosterone had beneficial effects on TOTP - induced neuropathy , greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either TOTP or DFP .
3961813	4	692	Neurotoxic esterase activities 24 hr after TOTP or DFP were less than 20 % of values measured in chickens not given organophosphorous compounds .
3961813	5	836	Chickens given 200 ppm corticosterone without TOTP or DFP had significantly elevated activity of plasma cholinesterase and significantly inhibited activity of liver carboxylesterase .
3961813	6	1019	Degenerating myelinated fibers were also evident in distal levels of the peripheral nerves of chickens given TOTP or DFP .
3962737	0	0	Hepatotoxicity of amiodarone .
3962737	1	30	Amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias .
3962737	2	133	The use of amiodarone has , however , been limited due to its serious side - effects .
3962737	3	215	A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given .
3962737	4	358	It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment , including steatosis , alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis , cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver .
3962737	5	576	Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels .
3962737	6	674	Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly .
3969369	0	0	Promotional effects of testosterone and dietary fat on prostate carcinogenesis in genetically susceptible rats .
3969369	1	112	Germfree ( GF ) Lobund strain Wistar ( LW ) rats , fed vegetable diet L - 485 , have developed prostate adenocarcinomas spontaneously ( 10 % incidence ) at average age 34 months .
3969369	2	280	Conventional LW rats , implanted with testosterone at age 4 months , developed a higher incidence of prostate cancer after an average interval of 14 months : 24 % had developed gross tumors , and 40 % when it included microscopic tumors .
3969369	3	512	Preliminary results indicate that testosterone - treated LW rats that were fed the same diet , which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20 % fat , developed prostate cancer after intervals of 6 - 12 months .
3969369	4	714	Aged GF Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rats have not developed prostate cancer spontaneously .
3969369	5	797	Conventional SD rats fed diet L - 485 and treated with testosterone developed only prostatitis .
3969369	6	891	Experimental designs should consider genetic susceptibility as a basic prerequisite for studies on experimental prostate cancer .
3973521	0	0	Time course alterations of QTC interval due to hypaque 76 .
3973521	1	59	Sequential measurement of QT interval during left ventricular angiography was made 30 seconds and one , three , five and ten minutes after injection of hypaque 76 .
3973521	2	221	The subjects were ten patients found to have normal left ventricles and coronary arteries .
3973521	3	312	Significant QTC prolongation occurred in 30 seconds to one minute in association with marked hypotension and elevation of cardiac output .
4038130	0	0	Rat extraocular muscle regeneration .
4038130	1	37	Repair of local anesthetic - induced damage .
4038130	2	80	Local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery ( 0 . 75 % bupivacaine hydrochloride , 2 . 0 % mepivacaine hydrochloride , and 2 . 0 % lidocaine hydrochloride plus 1 : 100 , 000 epinephrine ) were injected into the retrobulbar area of rat eyes .
4038130	3	323	Controls were injected with physiological saline .
4038130	4	373	All three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular muscles .
4038130	5	453	Muscle degeneration is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers .
4038130	6	531	In addition to muscle damage , severe damage was also seen in harderian glands , especially after exposure to mepivacaine and lidocaine plus epinephrine .
4038130	7	683	With these findings in rats , it is hypothesized that the temporary diplopia sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic - induced damage to the extraocular muscles .
4069770	0	0	Gentamicin nephropathy in a neonate .
4069770	1	37	The clinical and autopsy findings in a premature baby who died of acute renal failure after therapy with gentamicin ( 5 mg / kg / day ) and penicillin are presented .
4069770	2	197	The serum gentamicin concentration had reached toxic levels when anuria developed .
4069770	3	280	Numerous periodic acid Schiff ( PAS ) positive , diastase resistant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies which appeared as myelin figures in cytosegresomes under the electron microscope were identified in the proximal convoluted tubules .
4069770	4	507	The pathological changes induced by gentamicin in the human neonatal kidneys have not been previously reported .
4090988	0	0	Induction by paracetamol of bladder and liver tumours in the rat .
4090988	1	66	Effects on hepatocyte fine structure .
4090988	2	104	Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0 . 5 % or 1 . 0 % paracetamol by weight for up to 18 months .
4090988	3	244	At the 1 . 0 % dosage level , 20 % of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver , a statistically significant incidence .
4090988	4	378	These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration , the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats .
4090988	5	543	Papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol - treated groups , and three rats bore bladder carcinomas .
4090988	6	685	However , significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males .
4090988	7	798	Additionally , 20 to 25 % of paracetamol - treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium , which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi .
4090988	8	962	A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding .
4090988	9	1050	An electron microscope study of the livers of paracetamol - treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcinogens .
430165	0	0	Transient hemiparesis : a rare manifestation of diphenylhydantoin toxicity .
430165	1	75	Report of two cases .
430165	2	96	Among the common side effects of diphenylhydantoin ( DPH ) overdose , the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of cerebellar dysfunction .
430165	3	251	Very rarely , the toxic neurological manifestations of this drug are of cerebral origin .
430165	4	339	Two patients are presented who suffered progressive hemiparesis due to DPH overdose .
430165	5	424	Both had brain surgery before DPH treatment .
430165	6	469	It is assumed that patients with some cerebral damage are liable to manifest DPH toxicity as focal neurological signs .
458486	0	0	Tiapride in levodopa - induced involuntary movements .
458486	1	52	Tiapride , a substituted benzamide derivative closely related to metoclopramide , reduced levodopa - induced peak dose involuntary movements in 16 patients with idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease .
458486	2	241	However , an unacceptable increase in disability from Parkinsonism with aggravation of end - of - dose akinesia led to its cessation in 14 patients .
458486	3	385	Tiapride had no effect on levodopa - induced early morning of " off - period " segmental dystonia .
458486	4	478	These results fail to support the notion that levodopa - induced dyskinesias are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of dopamine receptors .
48362	0	0	Quinidine hepatitis .
48362	1	21	Long - term administration of quinidine was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT , lactic acid dehydrogenase , and alkaline phosphatase .
48362	2	186	Liver biopsy showed active hepatitis .
48362	3	224	Discontinuance of quinidine therapy led to normalization of liver function tests .
48362	4	306	A challenge dose of quinidine caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of SGOT , alkaline phosphatase , and lactic acid dehydrogenase values .
48362	5	451	We concluded that this patient had quinidine hepatotoxicity and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation .
48362	6	593	This report also suggests that , even after long - term administration , the hepatic toxicity is reversible .
591536	0	0	Arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy : a complication associated with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .
591536	1	138	Arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy .
591536	2	221	Characteristic of the entity is arterial occlusion by platelet - fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy , preceded by profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 per cubic millimeter .
591536	3	505	The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin , and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications .
591536	4	704	Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are reviewed .
591536	5	805	The common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin - induced platelet aggregation .
591536	6	910	Appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of heparin , and anticoagulation with sodium warfarin if necessary .
591536	7	1027	Vascular procedures are performed as indicated .
6111982	0	0	Pharmacology of GYKI - 41 099 ( chlorpropanol , Tobanum ) a new potent beta - adrenergic antagonist .
6111982	1	94	The compound GYKI - 41 099 , as a beta - adrenergic antagonist , is 3 - 8 times more potent than propranolol in vitro and in vivo .
6111982	2	217	Its antiarrhythmic effectiveness surpasses that of propranolol and pindolol inhibiting the ouabain arrhythmia in dogs and cats .
6111982	3	345	GYKI - 41 900 has a negligible cardiodepressant activity ; it is not cardioselective .
6111982	4	428	The compound shows a rapid and long lasting effect .
6111982	5	480	There was a prolonged elimination of the radioactivity after the injection of 14C - 41 099 to rats and dogs .
6111982	6	587	The half life of the unlabeled substance in humans was more than 10 hours .
6115999	0	0	Adverse reactions to bendrofluazide and propranolol for the treatment of mild hypertension .
6115999	1	92	Report of Medical Research Council Working Party on Mild to Moderate Hypertension .
6115999	2	175	Participants in the Medical Research Council treatment trial for mild hypertension are randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups : bendrofluazide , propranolol , or a placebo for either of these drugs .
6115999	3	383	The trial is single - blind . 23 582 patient - years of observation have been completed so far , 10 684 on active drugs and 12 898 on placebos .
6115999	4	521	The results show an association between bendrofluazide treatment and impotence , and impotence also occurred more frequently in patients taking propranolol than in those taking placebos .
6115999	5	707	Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include impaired glucose tolerance in men and women and gout in men , associated with bendrofluazide treatment , and Raynaud ' s phenomenon and dyspnoea in men and women taking propranolol .
6115999	6	956	No corneal disease is known to have occurred in the propranolol group .
6115999	7	1027	Mean serum potassium level fell , and urea and uric acid levels rose , in men and women taking bendrofluazide .
6115999	8	1136	In the propranolol group , serum potassium and uric acid levels rose in both sexes , but the urea level rose significantly in women only .
6118280	0	0	Serotonergic drugs , benzodiazepines and baclofen block muscimol - induced myoclonic jerks in a strain of mice .
6118280	1	109	In male Swiss mice , muscimol produced myoclonic jerks .
6118280	2	164	A 3 mg / kg ( i . p . ) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min .
6118280	3	312	Increasing the brain serotonin levels by the administration of 5 - hydroxytryptophan ( 80 - 160 mg / kg ) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the muscimol effect .
6118280	4	517	However , in a similar experiment l - dopa ( 80 - 160 mg / kg ) was without effect .
6118280	5	592	In doses of 3 - 10 mg / kg , the serotonin receptor agonist MK - 212 caused a dose - dependent blockade of the response of muscimol .
6118280	6	716	Of the benzodiazepines , clonazepam ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 mg / kg ) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam ( 0 . 3 - 3 mg / kg ) in blocking the myoclonic jerks .
6118280	7	869	While ( - ) - baclofen ( 1 - 3 mg / kg ) proved to be an effective antagonist of muscimol , its ( + ) - isomer ( 5 - 20 mg / kg ) lacked this property .
6118280	8	1000	Considering the fact that 5 - HTP and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical myoclonus , the muscimol - induced myoclonus seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition .
6118280	9	1286	Our present study indicated the possible value of MK - 212 and ( - ) - baclofen in the management of clinical myoclonus .
6127992	0	0	Adverse interaction between beta - adrenergic blocking drugs and verapamil - - report of three cases .
6127992	1	97	Three patients with ischaemic heart disease developed profound cardiac failure , hypotension and bradycardia during combined therapy with verapamil and beta - adrenergic blocking drugs .
6127992	2	280	This clinical picture resolved completely with cessation of the combined therapy .
6127992	3	362	Baseline left ventricular function , assessed by cardiac catheterisation or nuclear angiography , was normal in two patients and only mildly reduced in the other .
6127992	4	523	Simultaneously administration of beta - adrenergic blocking drugs and verapamil may result in profound adverse interactions and should only be administered with great caution .
6150641	0	0	Comparison of the effectiveness of ranitidine and cimetidine in inhibiting acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
6150641	1	138	The H2 - histamine receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short - and long - term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states .
6150641	2	363	Nineteen patients had Zollinger - Ellison syndrome , one patient had systemic mastocytosis , and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion .
6150641	3	500	The rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same .
6150641	4	577	The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents , and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion .
6150641	5	761	However , ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed ( 1 . 2 g per day for ranitidine and 3 . 6 g per day for cimetidine ) .
6150641	6	963	Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine .
6150641	7	1139	Treatment with high doses of cimetidine ( one to 60 months ; median , 11 months ) or ranitidine ( two to 31 months ; median , 14 months ) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations , but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy .
6150641	8	1496	The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
6150641	9	1615	Both are safe at high doses , but ranitidine is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of cimetidine .
6153967	0	0	Epileptogenic properties of enflurane and their clinical interpretation .
6153967	1	73	Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are reported .
6153967	2	165	In one patient , enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures .
6153967	3	278	Until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified , the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants .
6153967	4	398	Two other patients suffered from partial , complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication .
6153967	5	501	Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure - free .
6153967	6	617	Previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG .
6153967	7	727	On the other hand , enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings .
6203632	0	0	Development of isoproterenol - induced cardiac hypertrophy .
6203632	1	58	The development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol ( ISO ) ( 0 . 3 mg / kg body weight ) .
6203632	2	225	A time course was established for the change in tissue mass , RNA and DNA content , as well as hydroxyproline content .
6203632	3	342	Heart weight increased 44 % after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3 . 4 days .
6203632	4	425	Ventricular RNA content was elevated 26 % after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy .
6203632	5	556	The half time for RNA accumulation was 2 . 0 days .
6203632	6	605	The total content of hydroxyproline remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46 % after 4 days of therapy .
6203632	7	737	Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage ( 1 - 4 days ) of hypertrophic growth but increased to a new steady - state level 19 % above the controls after 8 days of treatment .
6203632	8	924	Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed hypertrophy .
6203632	9	1071	However , dP / dt in the ISO - treated hearts was slightly but significantly ( P less than 0 . 05 ) elevated .
6203632	10	1172	These data indicate that the adaptive response to ISO shows an early hypertrophic phase ( 1 - 4 days ) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA .
6203632	11	1377	However , prolonged stimulation ( 8 - 12 days ) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia within the heart .
6216862	0	0	Multiple side effects of penicillamine therapy in one patient with rheumatoid arthritis .
6216862	1	89	Skin rashes , proteinuria , systemic lupus erythematosus , polymyositis and myasthenia gravis have all been recorded as complications of penicillamine therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis .
6216862	2	284	A patient who had developed all 5 is now described .
6216862	3	336	The skin lesion resembled elastosis perforans serpiginosa , which has been reported as a rare side effect in patients with Wilson ' s disease but not in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with penicillamine .
625456	0	0	Obsolete but dangerous antacid preparations .
625456	1	45	One case of acute hypercalcaemia and two of recurrent nephrolithiasis are reported in patients who had regularly consumed large amounts of calcium carbon - ate - sodium bicarbonate powders for more than 20 years .
625456	2	254	The powders had been obtained from pharmacists unknown to the patients ' medical practitioners .
625456	3	349	It is suggested that these preparations were responsible for the patient ' s problems , and that such powders should no longer be freely obtainable .
6292680	0	0	Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in children with left - sided Wilms tumor .
6292680	1	68	Two children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney experienced severe anthracycline cardiomyopathy after irradiation to the tumor bed and conventional dosage of doxorubicin .
6292680	2	240	The cardiomyopathy is attributed 1 ) to the fact that radiation fields for left Wilms tumor include the lower portion of the heart and 2 ) to the interaction of doxorubicin and irradiation on cardiac muscle .
6292680	3	446	It is recommended that doxorubicin dosage be sharply restricted in children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney who receive postoperative irradiation .
6293644	0	0	Effects of calcitonin on rat extrapyramidal motor system : behavioral and biochemical data .
6293644	1	91	The effects of i . v . c . injection of human and salmon calcitonin on biochemical and behavioral parameters related to the extrapyramidal motor system , were investigated in male rats .
6293644	2	271	Calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of haloperidol - induced catalepsy and a partial prevention of apomorphine - induced hyperactivity .
6293644	3	415	Moreover calcitonin induced a significant decrease in nigral GAD activity but no change in striatal DA and DOPAC concentration or GAD activity .
6293644	4	559	The results are discussed in view of a primary action of calcitonin on the striatonigral GABAergic pathway mediating the DA - related behavioral messages of striatal origin .
6308526	0	0	Naloxazone pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory , temperature , and behavioral effects of morphine .
6308526	1	101	Behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of morphine were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or naloxazone , an antagonist of high - affinity mu 1 opioid receptors .
6308526	2	288	Pretreatment with naloxazone significantly blocked morphine analgesia , catalepsy and hypothermia at a dose which completely eliminated high - affinity binding in brain membranes .
6308526	3	465	Moreover , naloxazone significantly attenuated the morphine - induced hypotension and respiratory depression , whereas morphine - induced bradycardia was less affected .
6308526	4	628	Results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to morphine .
6323692	0	0	Modification of drug action by hyperammonemia .
6323692	1	47	Pretreatment with ammonium acetate ( NH4Ac ) ( 6 mmol / kg s . c . ) approximately doubled the time morphine - treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular incoordination by diazepam , but NH4Ac treatment alone had no effect .
6323692	2	288	Thus , hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease .
6323692	3	461	Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine - induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50 % by 0 . 3 mM NH4Ac and KCl - induced contractions of guinea - pig ileum were inhibited 20 % by 5 mM NH4Ac .
6323692	4	693	Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues , but calcium - independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac .
6323692	5	849	These results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels .
6323692	6	911	Parallels in the actions of NH4Ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept .
6323692	7	1009	Both verapamil ( 10 mg / kg i . p . ) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia - and diazepam - induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine - induced motor activity , and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol .
6323692	8	1265	The data suggest that hyperammonemia exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics .
6381653	0	0	Levodopa - induced dyskinesia and thalamotomy .
6381653	1	45	Levodopa - induced dyskinesia of the limbs in thirteen cases of Parkinsonism , which was choreic , ballistic or dystonic in type , was alleviated almost completely by stereotaxic surgery using a microelectrode technique for the ventralis oralis anterior and posterior nuclei of the thalamus , but much less by the ventralis intermedius nucleus .
6381653	2	384	Control of levodopa - induced dyskinesias by thalamic lesions in the course of routine treatment of Parkinsonism is discussed .
6402369	0	0	Treatment of ifosfamide - induced urothelial toxicity by oral administration of sodium 2 - mercaptoethane sulphonate ( MESNA ) to patients with inoperable lung cancer .
6402369	1	162	The protective effect of oral administration of the thiol compound sodium 2 - mercaptoethane sulphonate ( MESNA ) against urothelial toxicity induced by ifosfamide ( IF ) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable lung cancer under treatment with IF ( 2250 mg / m2 on days 2 - 5 ) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4 - week cycle .
6402369	2	507	MESNA was given orally on the days of treatment with IF in 3 doses of 840 mg / m2 , each administered at 0 hr ( = injection of IF ) , 4 hr and 8 hr p . i . Out of a total of 88 courses of this treatment we observed 10 episodes of asymptomatic microscopic haematuria and no episodes of gross haematuria .
6402369	3	801	In this group of 45 patients under protection with MESNA there were 5 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions ( total 31 % ) .
6402369	4	929	A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with IF were treated by conventional prophylactic measures ( raised fluid intake and forced diuresis ) .
6402369	5	1085	In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions ( total 24 % ) , but nearly all patients developed either gross haematuria and / or symptoms of bladder irritation ( cystitis and pollakisuria ) .
6402369	6	1284	There were no appreciable differences between the MESNA series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic toxicity of the cytostatic treatment .
6402369	7	1475	Our results support the view that MESNA , given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include IF , simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium .
6402369	8	1681	Protection with oral MESNA is particularly suitable for outpatients .
6415512	0	0	Myoclonic , atonic , and absence seizures following institution of carbamazepine therapy in children .
6415512	1	100	Five children , aged 3 to 11 years , treated with carbamazepine for epilepsy , had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of myoclonic , atypical absence and / or atonic ( minor motor ) seizures within a few days .
6415512	2	321	When the carbamazepine was discontinued , two of the children returned to their former state very quickly , two had the minor motor seizures resolve in 3 and 6 months , and one had the seizures persist .
6415512	3	521	The child in whom the seizures persisted was later found to have ceroid lipofuscinosis .
6415512	4	609	The other children are doing well on other anticonvulsants .
6433367	0	0	Effect of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors on experimentally induced convulsions in rats .
6433367	1	93	To investigate the relationship of prostaglandins ( PGs ) to seizure induction , the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on convulsions induced by flurothyl , picrotoxin , pentetrazol ( PTZ ) , electroshock or bicuculline were evaluated .
6433367	2	327	Ibuprofen , sulindac , mefenamic acid , and low dose meclofenamic acid increased the latency - to - onset in the flurothyl and / or PTZ models ; the electroshock , picrotoxin and bicuculline models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents .
6433367	3	581	These results suggest that PGs are involved in the mechanism ( s ) underlying fluorthyl - and PTZ - induced convulsions , but not picrotoxin - , electroshock - , or bicuculline - induced convulsions .
6436733	0	0	Acute changes of blood ammonia may predict short - term adverse effects of valproic acid .
6436733	1	88	Valproic acid ( VPA ) was given to 24 epileptic patients who were already being treated with other antiepileptic drugs .
6436733	2	206	A standardized loading dose of VPA was administered , and venous blood was sampled at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 hours .
6436733	3	316	Ammonia ( NH3 ) was higher in patients who , during continuous therapy , complained of drowsiness ( 7 patients ) than in those who were symptom - free ( 17 patients ) , although VPA plasma levels were similar in both groups .
6436733	4	530	By measuring VPA - induced changes of blood NH3 content , it may be possible to identify patients at higher risk of obtundation when VPA is given chronically .
6454943	0	0	Effect of captopril on pre - existing and aminonucleoside - induced proteinuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats .
6454943	1	112	Proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients .
6454943	2	190	The possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR .
6454943	3	284	Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg / kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre - existing in SHR .
6454943	4	395	Also , captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin aminonucleoside in SHR .
6454943	5	536	Captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations , excretion of urine , sodium and potassium , endogenous creatinine clearance , body weight , and food and water consumption .
6454943	6	741	However , ketone bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of captopril in SHR .
6496797	0	0	Complete heart block following a single dose of trazodone .
6496797	1	59	Forty minutes after receiving a single starting dose of trazodone , a patient developed complete heart block .
6496797	2	168	The case illustrates that , despite the results of earlier studies , trazodone ' s effect on cardiac conduction may be severe in individuals at risk for conduction delay .
6504332	0	0	Phenobarbital - induced dyskinesia in a neurologically - impaired child .
6504332	1	69	A 2 - year - old child with known neurologic impairment developed a dyskinesia soon after starting phenobarbital therapy for seizures .
6504332	2	200	Known causes of movement disorders were eliminated after evaluation .
6504332	3	269	On repeat challenge with phenobarbital , the dyskinesia recurred .
6504332	4	334	Phenobarbital should be added to the list of anticonvulsant drugs that can cause movement disorders .
6540303	0	0	Effects of amine pretreatment on ketamine catatonia in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals .
6540303	1	101	The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine - induced catatonia in the intact , pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat .
6540303	2	292	In the pinealectomized chick , pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia ( DOC ) after ketamine , but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not .
6540303	3	453	The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions .
6540303	4	501	Serotonin and N - acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC , did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland , whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick .
6540303	5	707	Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent ; furthermore , melatonin did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so .
6540303	6	919	This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood - brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat .
6540303	7	1117	In addition , these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by melatonin .
6540303	8	1239	Furthermore , dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine catatonia rather than directly on the pituitary .
6615052	0	0	Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia , thrombosis , and hemorrhage .
6615052	1	62	Sixty - two patients with a heparin - induced thrombocytopenia are reported .
6615052	2	135	Clinical manifestations of this disorder include hemorrhage or , more frequently , thromboembolic events in patients receiving heparin .
6615052	3	269	Laboratory testing has revealed a falling platelet count , increased resistance to heparin , and aggregation of platelets by the patient ' s plasma when heparin is added .
6615052	4	436	Immunologic testing has demonstrated the presence of a heparin - dependent platelet membrane antibody .
6615052	5	537	The 20 deaths , 52 hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications , and 21 surgical procedures to manage the complications confirm the seriousness of the disorder .
6615052	6	697	Specific risk factors have not been identified ; therefore , all patients receiving heparin should be monitored .
6615052	7	808	If the platelet count falls to less than 100 , 000 / mm3 , while the patient is receiving heparin , platelet aggregation testing , using the patient ' s plasma , is indicated .
6615052	8	974	Management consists of cessation of heparin , platelet anti - aggregating agents , and alternate forms of anticoagulation when indicated .
663266	0	0	Ventricular fibrillation from diatrizoate with and without chelating agents .
663266	1	77	The toxicity of Renografin 76 % was compared with that of Hypaque 76 % by selective injection of each into the right coronary artery of dogs .
663266	2	217	Renografin contains the chelating agents sodium citrate and disodium edetate , while Hypaque contains calcium disodium edetate and no sodium citrate .
663266	3	366	Ventricular fibrillation occurred significantly more often with Renografin , suggesting that chelating agents contribute to toxicity in coronary angiography .
6637851	0	0	Long - term efficacy and toxicity of high - dose amiodarone therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation .
6637851	1	121	Amiodarone was administered to 154 patients who had sustained , symptomatic ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) ( n = 118 ) or a cardiac arrest ( n = 36 ) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs .
6637851	2	326	The loading dose was 800 mg / day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg / day .
6637851	3	411	Sixty - nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) over a follow - up of 6 to 52 months ( mean + / - standard deviation 14 . 2 + / - 8 . 2 ) .
6637851	4	630	Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug .
6637851	5	820	One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51 % of patients .
6637851	6	884	Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of amiodarone in 41 % and discontinuation of amiodarone in 10 % of patients .
6637851	7	1006	The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were tremor or ataxia ( 35 % ) , nausea and anorexia ( 8 % ) , visual halos or blurring ( 6 % ) , thyroid function abnormalities ( 6 % ) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates ( 5 % ) .
6637851	8	1219	Although large - dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long - term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs , it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50 % of patients .
6637851	9	1423	However , when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects , 75 % of patients with VT or VF can be successfully managed with amiodarone .
6674249	0	0	Why may epsilon - aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) induce myopathy in man ?
6674249	1	65	Report of a case and literature review .
6674249	2	105	A case of necrotizing myopathy due to a short epsilon - aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) treatment in a 72 year - old patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) is described .
6674249	3	269	Pathogenetic hypotheses are discussed .
6695415	0	0	Cerebral hemorrhage associated with phenylpropanolamine in combination with caffeine .
6695415	1	86	Phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including stroke .
6695415	2	191	It is often combined with caffeine in diet preparations and " look - alike " pills .
6695415	3	271	In order to determine if PPA / caffeine can lead to stroke in normotensive and / or hypertensive rats , we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days .
6695415	4	517	Subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage was noted in 18 % of the hypertensive rats .
6695415	5	597	A single PPA / caffeine administration ( same dose ) lead to acute hypertension in both the normotensive and hypertensive animals .
6695415	6	724	These results suggest that PPA / caffeine can lead to cerebral hemorrhage in previously hypertensive animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage .
6695415	7	885	An acute elevation in blood pressure may be a contributing factor .
6699841	0	0	Renal papillary necrosis due to naproxen .
6699841	1	42	A 31 - year - old man with rheumatoid arthritis , who had previously been treated with sulindac , fenoprofen calcium , high dose salicylates and gold salts , developed renal papillary necrosis ( RPN ) 4 months after institution of naproxen therapy .
6699841	2	281	No other factor predisposing to RPN could be discovered .
6699841	3	338	Sulindac was substituted for naproxen and no further adverse renal effects occurred over the next 12 months .
6699841	4	447	We review previous reports linking RPN to antiinflammatory drug use and discuss possible advantages of sulindac in patients who have experienced renal toxicity from other antiinflammatory agents .
6728084	0	0	Nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycoside treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation .
6728084	1	96	To quantify the effects of gentamicin , kanamycin and netilmicin on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation , these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally ( 30 mg / kg / day ) for 7 , 14 or 21 days .
6728084	2	301	Scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endothelia , urinary measurements of sodium , potassium , endogenous lysozyme , N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i . v . administration of egg - white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance ( GFR ) were done in each treatment group .
6728084	3	638	Gentamicin administration decreased diameter , density and shape of endothelial fenestrae .
6728084	4	728	Kanamycin and netilmicin appeared to have no effect at the dose used .
6728084	5	798	All three aminoglycosides decreased GFR and increased urinary excretion of sodium and potassium .
6728084	6	895	While gentamicin and kanamycin decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i . v . administration of egg - white lysozyme netilmicin had no effect .
6728084	7	1067	Daily excretion of total protein , endogenous lysozyme and NAG increased only after treatment with kanamycin and gentamicin .
6728084	8	1191	Thus , aminoglycosides may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and / or tubular level inducing impairment of renal reabsorption and accumulation of proteins .
6732043	0	0	Induction of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in a woman by exogenous androgen administration .
6732043	1	99	We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54 - yr - old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens .
6732043	2	348	When the androgens were withdrawn , the patient ' s physical changes , symptoms , sleep study , and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal .
6732043	3	490	A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone .
6732043	4	607	Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea .
6732043	5	693	Our report provides direct evidence for this role .
6732043	6	744	Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep .
6732043	7	942	Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy .
6769133	0	0	Cardiotoxic and possible leukemogenic effects of adriamycin in nonhuman primates . 10 monkeys ( macaques ) received adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg / m2 ( 1 mg / kg ) . 8 of the 10 monkeys developed congestive heart failure at an average cumulative adriamycin dose ( 310 mg / m2 ) well below that considered the safe upper limit ( 550 mg / m2 ) in man .
6769133	1	357	Histologically , the myocardial lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline - induced cardiomyopathy . 1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute myeloblastic leukemia after receiving 324 mg / m2 of adriamycin ; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug .
6769133	2	637	Our results suggest that adriamycin is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man , and that leukemia may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug .
6794356	0	0	Tricuspid valve regurgitation and lithium carbonate toxicity in a newborn infant .
6794356	1	82	A newborn with massive tricuspid regurgitation , atrial flutter , congestive heart failure , and a high serum lithium level is described .
6794356	2	217	This is the first patient to initially manifest tricuspid regurgitation and atrial flutter , and the 11th described patient with cardiac disease among infants exposed to lithium compounds in the first trimester of pregnancy .
6794356	3	441	Sixty - three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve involvement .
6794356	4	511	Lithium carbonate may be a factor in the increasing incidence of congenital heart disease when taken during early pregnancy .
6794356	5	636	It also causes neurologic depression , cyanosis , and cardiac arrhythmia when consumed prior to delivery .
6817363	0	0	Effects of the novel compound aniracetam ( Ro 13 - 5057 ) upon impaired learning and memory in rodents .
6817363	1	100	The effect of aniracetam ( Ro 13 - 5057 , 1 - anisoyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone ) was studied on various forms of experimentally impaired cognitive functions ( learning and memory ) in rodents and produced the following effects : ( 1 ) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session ; ( 2 ) partial ( rats ) or complete ( mice ) prevention of the scopolamine - induced short - term amnesia for a passive avoidance task ; ( 3 ) complete protection against amnesia for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition ; ( 4 ) prevention of the long - term retention - or retrieval - deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by chloramphenicol or cycloheximide administered immediately after acquisition ; ( 5 ) reversal , when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test , of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by cycloheximide injected 2 days previously ; ( 6 ) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or hypercapnia applied immediately before retrieval testing ( 24 h after acquisition ) .
6817363	2	1361	These improvements or normalizations of impaired cognitive functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10 - 100 mg / kg .
6817363	3	1482	Generally , the dose - response curves were bell - shaped .
6817363	4	1536	The mechanisms underlying the activity of aniracetam and its ' therapeutic window ' are unknown .
6817363	5	1631	Piracetam , another pyrrolidinone derivative was used for comparison .
6817363	6	1700	It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one - tenth the potency of aniracetam .
6817363	7	1791	The results indicate that aniracetam improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process .
6892185	0	0	Effect of calcium chloride on gross behavioural changes produced by carbachol and eserine in cats .
6892185	1	99	The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group - housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization ( rage , hissing and snarling ) , fighting ( attack with paws and claws , defense with paws and claws and biting ) , mydriasis , tremor and clonic - tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated .
6892185	2	450	Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine .
6892185	3	568	On the other hand , mydriasis , tremor and clonic - tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride .
6892185	4	718	It is apparent that calcium chloride can " dissociate " vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis , tremor and clonic - tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine .
6892185	5	921	Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites .
6892185	6	1106	These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine - like action also in the central nervous system .
6942642	0	0	Thiazide diuretics , hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias .
6942642	1	57	Thiazide diuretics are widely accepted as the cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment programs .
6942642	2	155	Hypokalemia is a commonly encountered metabolic consequence of chronic thiazide therapy .
6942642	3	244	We treated 38 patients ( 22 low renin , 16 normal renin ) with moderate diastolic hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTC ) administered on a twice daily schedule .
6942642	4	408	Initial dose was 50 mg and the dose was increased at monthly intervals to 100 mg , 150 mg and 200 mg daily until blood pressure normalized .
6942642	5	547	The serum K during the control period was 4 . 5 + / - 0 . 2 mEq / l an on 50 , 100 , 150 and 200 mg HCTZ daily 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 3 , 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 2 , 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 2 , and 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 3 mEq / l , respectively .
6942642	6	724	Corresponding figures for whole body K were 4107 + / - 208 , 3722 + / - 319 , 3628 + / - 257 , 3551 + / - 336 , and 3269 + / - 380 mEq , respectively .
6942642	7	860	In 13 patients we observed the effects of HCTZ therapy ( 100 mg daily ) on the occurrence of PVC ' s during rest as well as during static and dynamic exercise .
6942642	8	1016	During rest we observed 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 08 PVC beats / min + / - SEM and during static and dynamic exercise 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 06 and 0 . 8 + / - 0 . 15 , respectively .
6942642	9	1159	Corresponding figures during HCTZ therapy 100 mg daily were 1 . 4 + / - 0 . 1 , 3 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 and 5 . 7 4 / - 0 . 8 , respectively .
6942642	10	1275	The occurrence of PVC ' s correlated significantly with the fall in serum K + observed r = 0 . 72 , p less than 0 . 001 .
6942642	11	1388	In conclusion we found that thiazide diuretics cause hypokalemia and depletion of body potassium .
6942642	12	1486	The more profound hypokalemia , the greater the propensity for the occurrence of PVC ' s .
7007443	0	0	Circulating lysosomal enzymes and acute hepatic necrosis .
7007443	1	58	The activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease , N - acetylglucosaminidase , and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with fulminant hepatic failure .
7007443	2	242	Acid protease ( cathepsin D ) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose , whereas activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survived .
7007443	3	562	A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time , and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase , which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall .
7007443	4	809	Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs , and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition .
7053705	0	0	Hepatic veno - occlusive disease caused by 6 - thioguanine .
7053705	1	56	Clinically reversible veno - occlusive disease of the liver developed in a 23 - year - old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia after 10 months of maintenance therapy with 6 - thioguanine .
7053705	2	236	Serial liver biopsies showed the development and resolution of intense sinusoidal engorgement .
7053705	3	331	Although this disease was clinically reversible , some subintimal fibrosis about the terminal hepatic veins persisted .
7053705	4	449	This case presented a unique opportunity to observe the histologic features of clinically reversible hepatic veno - occlusive disease over time , and may be the first case of veno - occlusive related solely to 6 - thioguanine .
7059267	0	0	Chlorpropamide - induced optic neuropathy .
7059267	1	41	A 65 - year - old woman with adult - onset diabetes treated with chlorpropamide ( Diabenese ) had a toxic optic neuropathy that resolved with discontinuation of chlorpropamide therapy .
7059267	2	218	Visual loss occurs in diabetics for a variety of reasons , and accurate diagnosis is necessary to institute appropriate therapy .
7059267	3	346	The possibility of a drug - induced optic neuropathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of visual loss in diabetics .
7066357	0	0	Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of nephrotic syndrome induced in the rat by puromycin aminonucleoside .
7066357	1	137	This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were due to nephrotic syndrome per se , or , at least in part , to the aminonucleoside .
7066357	2	373	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside ( 20 mg / kg for 7 days ) and the subsequent development of nephrotic syndrome .
7066357	3	603	Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment , the time - course study was divided into two stages : pre - nephrotic stage ( day 1 - 5 ) and nephrotic stage ( day 6 - 11 ) .
7066357	4	778	In pre - nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty acids , triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid , cholesteryl esters and HDL remained constant .
7066357	5	943	Plasma apolipoprotein A - I tended to increase ( 40 % increase at day 5 ) .
7066357	6	1013	At the beginning of nephrotic stage ( day 6 ) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level , while that of apolipoprotein A - I increased abruptly ( 4 - fold increase ) and continued to rise , although less steeply , in the following days .
7066357	7	1261	The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern .
7066357	8	1320	Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage ( day 9 ) .
7066357	9	1376	Plasma apolipoprotein A - I was found not only in HDL ( 1 . 063 - 1 . 210 g / ml ) but also in the LDL density class ( 1 . 025 - 1 . 050 g / ml ) .
7066357	10	1501	In the pre - nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible , while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL .
7066357	11	1660	These observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL .
7066357	12	1783	It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism .
7072798	0	0	Fatal aplastic anemia following topical administration of ophthalmic chloramphenicol .
7072798	1	86	A 73 - year - old woman died of aplastic anemia less than two months after undergoing cataract extraction and beginning topical therapy with chloramphenicol .
7072798	2	240	The first signs of pancytopenia began within one month of the surgery .
7072798	3	311	The pattern of the aplastic anemia was associated with an idiosyncratic response to chloramphenicol .
7072798	4	412	This was the second report of fatal aplastic anemia after topical treatment with chloramphenicol for ocular conditions , although two cases of reversible bone marrow hypoplasia have also been reported .
7072798	5	613	Any other suspected cases of ocular toxicity associated with topically applied chloramphenicol should be reported to the National Registry of Drug - Induced Ocular Side Effects , Oregon Health Sciences University , Portland , OR 97201 .
7102237	0	0	Midazolam compared with thiopentone as an induction agent .
7102237	1	59	In patients premedicated with scopolamine + morphine ( + 5 mg nitrazepam the evening before surgery ) , the sleep - inducing effect of midazolam 0 . 15 mg / kg i . v . was clearly slower in onset than that of thiopentone 4 . 67 mg / kg i . v . Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the midazolam group , but , although apnoea occurred less often in the midazolam group it lasted longer .
7102237	2	449	On the whole , the differences between midazolam and thiopentone had no apparent clinical consequences .
7102237	3	552	Midazolam is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia .
7161250	0	0	Extrapyramidal side effects and oral haloperidol : an analysis of explanatory patient and treatment characteristics .
7161250	1	116	The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects ( EPS ) was evaluated in 98 patients treated with haloperidol .
7161250	2	222	The incidence of parkinsonism was higher at higher doses of haloperidol and in younger patients .
7161250	3	319	Prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication was effective in younger but not in older patients .
7161250	4	412	However , these medications were more effective in both young and old patients when given after parkinsonism developed .
7161250	5	531	Akathisia was controlled by the benzodiazepine lorazepam in 14 out of 16 patients , while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective .
7161250	6	669	The present study points to patient characteristics that may be of significance in the development of EPS due to haloperidol .
7189975	0	0	Deaths from local anesthetic - induced convulsions in mice .
7189975	1	58	Median convulsant ( CD50 ) and median lethal ( LD50 ) doses of three representative local anesthetics were determined in adult mice to evaluate the threat to life of local anesthetic - induced convulsions .
7189975	2	258	The CD50 and LD50 , respectively , were 57 . 7 and 58 . 7 mg / kg for bupivacaine , 111 . 0 and 133 . 1 mg / kg for lidocaine , and 243 . 4 and 266 . 5 mg / kg for chloroprocaine .
7189975	3	416	When given intraperitoneally , bupivacaine thus was only about twice as toxic as lidocaine and four times as toxic as chloroprocaine .
7189975	4	549	Convulsions always preceded death , except after precipitous cardiopulmonary arrest from extreme doses .
7189975	5	652	A CD50 dose of local anesthetic ( causing convulsions in 50 % of mice ) was fatal in 90 % of bupivacaine - induced seizures , in 57 % of the chloroprocaine group , and in 6 % of the lidocaine group .
7189975	6	841	The narrow gap between convulsant and lethal doses of local anesthetics indicates that untreated convulsions present much more of a threat to life than heretofore appreciated .
7197363	0	0	REM sleep deprivation changes behavioral response to catecholaminergic and serotonergic receptor activation in rats .
7197363	1	117	The effects of REM sleep deprivation ( REMD ) on apomorphine - induced aggressiveness and quipazine - induced head twitches in rats were determined .
7197363	2	260	Forty - eight hr of REMD increased apomorphine - induced aggressiveness , and reduced ( immediately after completing of REMD ) or increased ( 96 hr after completing of REMD ) quipazine - induced head twitches .
7197363	3	459	Results are discussed in terms of similarity to pharmacological effects of other antidepressive treatments .
7263204	0	0	Fatal aplastic anemia due to indomethacin - - lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro .
7263204	1	85	Although indomethacin has been implicated as a possible cause of aplastic anemia on the basis of a few clinical observations , its role has not been definitely established .
7263204	2	257	A case of fatal aplastic anemia is described in which no drugs other than allopurinol and indomethacin were given .
7263204	3	372	Indomethacin was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms .
7263204	4	444	A positive lymphocyte transformation test with indomethacin in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing aplastic anemia in a susceptible patient .
7263204	5	620	Fortunately , this seems to be a very rare complication .
7282516	0	0	Dose - effect and structure - function relationships in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy .
7282516	1	80	The cardiomyopathy ( CM ) produced by the anticancer drug doxorubicin ( DXR ) ( Adriamycin ) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose - effect and structure - function relationships during development of myocardial disease .
7282516	2	299	We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving DXR .
7282516	3	499	Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative DXR dose between 100 and 600 mg / m2 .
7282516	4	612	Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose , exhibited a curvilinear relationship , and had a " threshold " for expression .
7282516	5	743	Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage ( r = 0 . 57 to 0 . 78 ) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured , and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear , threshold configuration .
7282516	6	980	In DXR - CM myocardial damage is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult ( DXR dose ) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached , after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly .
7337133	0	0	Massive cerebral edema associated with fulminant hepatic failure in acetaminophen overdose : possible role of cranial decompression .
7337133	1	132	Cerebral edema may complicate the course of fulminant hepatic failure .
7337133	2	203	Response to conventional therapy has been disappointing .
7337133	3	260	We present a patient with fatal acetaminophen - induced fulminant hepatic failure , with signs and symptoms of cerebral edema , unresponsive to conventional medical therapy .
7337133	4	430	Cranial decompression was carried out .
7337133	5	469	A justification of the need for further evaluation of cranial decompression in such patients is presented .
7416947	0	0	Subjective assessment of sexual dysfunction of patients on long - term administration of digoxin .
7416947	1	96	Various data suggest that male patients who have received digoxin on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) .
7416947	2	296	This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long - term administration of digoxin therapy and sexual behavior , and the effect of digoxin on plasma levels of estradiol , testosterone , and LH .
7416947	3	503	The patients of the study and control group ( without digoxin ) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age ( 25 - 40 years ) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients .
7416947	4	701	A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out , using parameters such as sexual desire , sexual excitement , and frequency of sexual relations .
7416947	5	887	Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior .
7416947	6	981	The findings support the reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma estradiol , testosterone , and LH .
7416947	7	1083	The differences in the means were significant .
7416947	8	1130	Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant decrease in sexual desire , sexual excitement phase ( erection ) , and frequency of sexual relations in the study group .
7421734	0	0	Endometrial carcinoma after Hodgkin disease in childhood .
7421734	1	58	A 34 - year - old patient developed metastic endometrial carcinoma after Hodgkin disease in childhood .
7421734	2	157	She had ovarian failure after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for Hodgkin disease , and received exogenous estrogens , a treatment implicated in the development of endometrial cancer in menopausal women .
7421734	3	366	Young women on replacement estrogens for ovarian failure after cancer therapy may also have increased risk of endometrial carcinoma and should be examined periodically .
7437994	0	0	Long - term lithium treatment and the kidney .
7437994	1	44	Interim report on fifty patients .
7437994	2	78	This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long - term lithium treatment on the kidney .
7437994	3	187	Creatinine clearance , maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long - term lithium for more than one year .
7437994	4	368	These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to lithium , available for most of our patients .
7437994	5	516	No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during lithium treatment .
7437994	6	607	Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre - lithium values .
7437994	7	720	Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients .
7437994	8	904	The concentration defect appeared reversible , at least in part .
7437994	9	968	Polyuria above 3 litres / 24 hours was found in 10 % of patients .
7437994	10	1031	An attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings .
7542793	0	0	Nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin A and FK506 : inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase .
7542793	1	82	Cyclosporin A ( CsA ; 50 mg / kg ) and Fujimycine ( FK506 ; 5 mg / kg ) , but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin ( 5 mg / kg ) , caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate , degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium , and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days .
7542793	2	410	The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 toxicity were investigated .
7542793	3	480	Cyclophilin A and FK506 - binding protein , the main intracytoplasmic receptors for CsA and FK506 , respectively , were each detected in renal tissue extract .
7542793	4	634	In the kidney , high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506 , but not by rapamycin .
7542793	5	811	Finally , specific immunophilin - drug - calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506 , but not rapamycin .
7542793	6	934	These results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase .
7565311	0	0	Acute renal failure in high dose carboplatin chemotherapy .
7565311	1	59	Carboplatin has been reported to cause acute renal failure when administered in high doses to adult patients .
7565311	2	169	We report a 4 1 / 2 - year - old girl who was treated with high - dose carboplatin for metastatic parameningeal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma .
7565311	3	301	Acute renal failure developed followed by a slow partial recovery of renal function .
7565311	4	386	Possible contributing factors are discussed .
7596955	0	0	Clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral prostacyclin analogue beraprost and phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol .
7596955	1	131	Among various oral antiplatelets , a combination of a novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost ( BPT ) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol ( CLZ ) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular cAMP ( cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate ) .
7596955	2	426	Thereby , a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted .
7596955	3	516	Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take BPT / CLZ in the following schedule ; BPT : 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t . i . d . from day 7 to 14 , CLZ : 200 mg t . i . d . from day 3 to 14 .
7596955	4	708	At various time intervals , physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cAMP were performed .
7596955	5	866	Throughout the observation period , no significant alteration in vital signs was observed .
7596955	6	956	Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one , especially after ingestion of CLZ .
7596955	7	1109	All of these symptoms , probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents , were of mild degree and no special treatment was required .
7596955	8	1253	Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9 . 84 + / - 4 . 59 pmol per 10 ( 9 ) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value ( 6 . 87 + / - 2 . 25 pmol ) .
7596955	9	1433	The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted .
7596955	10	1606	In conclusion , the combined administration of BPT / CLZ is safe at doses used in the study , though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated .
7604176	0	0	Pravastatin - associated myopathy .
7604176	1	33	Report of a case .
7604176	2	51	A case of acute inflammatory myopathy associated with the use of pravastatin , a new hydrophilic 3 - hydroxy - 3 methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase inhibitor , is reported .
7604176	3	219	The patient , a 69 - year - old man was affected by non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension .
7604176	4	324	He assumed pravastatin ( 20 mg / day ) because of hypercholesterolemia .
7604176	5	392	He was admitted with acute myopathy of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after pravastatin discontinuation .
7604176	6	511	A previously unknown hypothyroidism , probably due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis , was evidenced .
7604176	7	611	Muscle biopsy ( left gastrocnemius ) revealed a perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltrate with a prevalence of CD4 + lymphocytes .
7604176	8	746	While lovastatin and simvastatin have been associated with toxic myopathy , pravastatin - associated myopathy could represent a distinct , inflammatory entity .
761833	0	0	Reversal of ammonia coma in rats by L - dopa : a peripheral effect .
761833	1	65	Ammonia coma was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1 . 7 mmol NH4CL .
761833	2	173	This coma was prevented with 1 . 68 mmol L - dopa given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the ammonium salt injection .
761833	3	294	The effect of L - dopa was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain ammonia , an increase in brain dopamine , and an increase in renal excretion of ammonia and urea .
761833	4	461	Intraventricular infusion of dopamine sufficient to raise the brain dopamine to the same extent did not prevent the ammonia coma nor affect the blood and brain ammonia concentrations .
761833	5	645	Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of L - dopa on blood and brain ammonia and the ammonia coma was not prevented .
761833	6	777	Thus , the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma after L - dopa , can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of dopamine on renal function rather than its central action .
761833	7	981	These results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some encephalopathic patients receiving L - dopa .
7619765	0	0	Etoposide - related myocardial infarction .
7619765	1	41	The occurrence of a myocardial infarction is reported after chemotherapy containing etoposide , in a man with no risk factors for coronary heart disease .
7619765	2	194	Possible causal mechanisms are discussed .
7647582	0	0	Halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross - react with halothane - induced antibodies .
7647582	1	108	Two halogenated anesthetics , enflurane and isoflurane , have been associated with an allergic - type hepatic injury both alone and following previous exposure to halothane .
7647582	2	278	Halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response .
7647582	3	346	An antibody response to a protein - bound biotransformation product ( trifluoroacetyl adduct ) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients .
7647582	4	488	This study was performed to determine cross - reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane .
7647582	5	624	The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane - induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane , and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models .
7647582	6	852	Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver .
7647582	7	1023	In the same liver , biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20 - fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats .
7647582	8	1159	This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and / or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration .
7647582	9	1394	The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens .
7650771	0	0	Cholinergic toxicity resulting from ocular instillation of echothiophate iodide eye drops .
7650771	1	91	A patient developed a severe cholinergic syndrome from the use of echothiophate iodide ophthalmic drops , presented with profound muscle weakness and was initially given the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis .
7650771	2	296	Red blood cell and serum cholinesterase levels were severely depressed and symptoms resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of the eye drops .
7651879	0	0	Seizure after flumazenil administration in a pediatric patient .
7651879	1	64	Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse sedation and respiratory depression induced by benzodiazepines .
7651879	2	195	Seizures and cardiac arrhythmias have complicated its use in adult patients .
7651879	3	272	Overdose patients who have coingested tricyclic antidepressants have a higher risk of these complications .
7651879	4	379	Little information exists concerning adverse effects of flumazenil in children .
7651879	5	459	We report the occurrence of a generalized tonic - clonic seizure in a pediatric patient following the administration of flumazenil .
7707116	0	0	Phase I trial of 13 - cis - retinoic acid in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation .
7707116	1	108	PURPOSE : Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with 13 - cis - retinoic acid ( cis - RA ) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation .
7707116	2	239	Since cis - RA has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients , it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy .
7707116	3	382	This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal - tolerated dosage ( MTD ) , toxicities , and pharmacokinetics of cis - RA administered on an intermittent schedule in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) .
7707116	4	623	PATIENTS AND METHODS : Fifty - one assessable patients , 2 to 12 years of age , were treated with oral cis - RA administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks , followed by a 2 - week rest period , for up to 12 courses .
7707116	5	845	The dose was escalated from 100 to 200 mg / m2 / d until dose - limiting toxicity ( DLT ) was observed .
7707116	6	941	A single intrapatient dose escalation was permitted .
7707116	7	994	RESULTS : The MTD of cis - RA was 160 mg / m2 / d .
7707116	8	1038	Dose - limiting toxicities in six of nine patients at 200 mg / m2 / d included hypercalcemia ( n = 3 ) , rash ( n = 2 ) , and anemia / thrombocytopenia / emesis / rash ( n = 1 ) .
7707116	9	1197	All toxicities resolved after cis - RA was discontinued .
7707116	10	1252	Three complete responses were observed in marrow metastases .
7707116	11	1313	Serum levels of 7 . 4 + / - 3 . 0 mumol / L ( peak ) and 4 . 0 + / - 2 . 8 mumol / L ( trough ) at the MTD were maintained during 14 days of therapy .
7707116	12	1443	The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol / L .
7707116	13	1499	CONCLUSION : The MTD of cis - RA given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg / m2 / d .
7707116	14	1582	Serum levels known to be effective against neuroblastoma in vitro were achieved at this dose .
7707116	15	1676	The DLT included hypercalcemia , and may be predicted by serum cis - RA levels .
7707116	16	1753	Monitoring of serum calcium and cis - RA levels is indicated in future trials .
7710775	0	0	Time dependence of plasma malondialdehyde , oxypurines , and nucleosides during incomplete cerebral ischemia in the rat .
7710775	1	119	Incomplete cerebral ischemia ( 30 min ) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries .
7710775	2	233	Peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times ( once every 5 min ) before ischemia ( 0 time ) and 5 , 15 , and 30 min after ischemia .
7710775	3	395	Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high - performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of malondialdehyde , oxypurines , and nucleosides .
7710775	4	572	During ischemia , a time - dependent increase of plasma oxypurines and nucleosides was observed .
7710775	5	666	Plasma malondialdehyde , which was present in minimal amount at zero time ( 0 . 058 mumol / liter plasma ; SD 0 . 015 ) , increased after 5 min of ischemia , resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion ( 0 . 298 mumol / liter plasma ; SD 0 . 078 ) .
7710775	6	917	Increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model , one receiving 20 mg / kg b . w . of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia , the other receiving 650 micrograms / kg b . w . of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters / min intravenously during ischemia , although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly higher .
7710775	7	1383	The present data indicate that the determination of malondialdehyde , oxypurines , and nucleosides in peripheral blood , may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
7724492	0	0	Acute renal toxicity of doxorubicin ( adriamycin ) - loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles .
7724492	1	85	Acute doxorubicin - loaded nanoparticle ( DXNP ) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis .
7724492	2	225	In normal rats , 2 / 6 rats given free doxorubicin ( DX ) ( 5 mg / kg ) died within one week , whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived .
7724492	3	393	A 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with DX .
7724492	4	491	Free NP did not provoke any proteinuria .
7724492	5	532	Two hr post - injection , DXNP was 2 . 7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free DX ( p < 0 . 025 ) .
7724492	6	629	In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis , 5 / 6 rats given DX died within 7 days , in contrast to animals treated by DXNP , NP , or untreated , which all survived .
7724492	7	798	Proteinuria appeared in all series , but was 2 - 5 times more intense ( p > 0 . 001 ) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment ( 400 - 700 mg / day ) , without significant difference between DXNP and DX .
7724492	8	989	Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls .
7724492	9	1038	These results demonstrate that , in these experimental conditions , DXNP killed less animals than free DX , despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former .
7724492	10	1196	Both effects ( better survival and nephrosis ) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system , including mesangial cells .
7752389	0	0	Prostaglandin E2 - induced bladder hyperactivity in normal , conscious rats : involvement of tachykinins ?
7752389	1	102	In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry , intravesically instilled prostaglandin ( PG ) E2 facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure .
7752389	2	280	The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist RP 67 , 580 and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR 48 , 968 , given intra - arterially , suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors .
7752389	3	517	Intra - arterially given PGE2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex , indicating that the PG had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle .
7752389	4	720	The effect of intra - arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra - arterial RP 67 , 580 or SR 48 , 968 , which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically .
7752389	5	1000	The present results thus suggest that intra - arterial PGE2 , given near the bladder , may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor .
7752389	6	1193	However , when given intravesically , PGE2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and / or immediately below the urothelium .
7752389	7	1341	These tachykinins , in turn , initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK1 and NK2 receptors .
7752389	8	1437	Prostanoids may , via release of tachykinins , contribute to both urge and bladder hyperactivity seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract .
7785794	0	0	Refractory cardiogenic shock and complete heart block after verapamil SR and metoprolol treatment .
7785794	1	99	A case report .
7785794	2	114	A seventy - eight - year - old woman presented with complete heart block and refractory hypotension two days after a therapeutic dose of sustained - release verapamil with concomitant use of metoprolol .
7785794	3	309	The patient continued to remain hypotensive with complete heart block , even with multiple uses of intravenous atropine as well as high doses of pressor agents such as dopamine and dobutamine .
7785794	4	501	However , shortly after the use of intravenous calcium chloride , the refractory hypotension and complete heart block resolved .
7791169	0	0	Protective effect of misoprostol on indomethacin induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients .
7791169	1	96	OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with indomethacin .
7791169	2	244	METHODS : Forty - five hospitalized elderly patients ( > 65 years old ) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin , 150 mg / day ( Group A ) , or indomethacin 150 mg / day plus misoprostol at 0 . 6 mg / day ( Group B ) .
7791169	3	527	Laboratory variables of renal function [ serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and electrolytes ] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days , until termination of the study ( a period of at least 6 days ) .
7791169	4	753	Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain .
7791169	5	838	RESULTS : Forty - two patients completed the study , 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B . BUN and creatinine increased by > 50 % of baseline levels in 54 and 45 % of Group A patients , respectively , compared to only 20 and 10 % of Group B patients ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
7791169	6	1086	Potassium ( K ) increment of 0 . 6 mEq / l or more was observed in 50 % of Group A , but in only 15 % of Group B patients ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
7791169	7	1211	The mean increments in BUN , creatinine , and K were reduced by 63 , 80 , and 42 % , respectively , in Group B patients compared to Group A . Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups .
7791169	8	1418	CONCLUSION : Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal dysfunction .
7791169	9	1527	Addition of misoprostol can minimize this renal impairment without affecting pain control .
7803371	0	0	Cognitive deterioration from long - term abuse of dextromethorphan : a case report .
7803371	1	81	Dextromethorphan ( DM ) , the dextrorotatory isomer of 3 - hydroxy - N - methylmorphinan , is the main ingredient in a number of widely available , over - the - counter antitussives .
7803371	2	249	Initial studies ( Bornstein 1968 ) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability .
7803371	3	370	Subsequently , however , several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature .
7803371	4	472	The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects , ranging from nausea , restlessness , insomnia , ataxia , slurred speech and nystagmus to mood changes , perceptual alterations , inattention , disorientation and aggressive behavior ( Rammer et al 1988 ; Katona and Watson 1986 ; Isbell and Fraser 1953 ; Devlin et al 1985 ; McCarthy 1971 ; Dodds and Revai 1967 ; Degkwitz 1964 ; Hildebrand et al 1989 ) .
7803371	5	871	There have also been two reported fatalities from DM overdoses ( Fleming 1986 ) .
7803371	6	950	However , there are no reports describing the effects of chronic abuse .
7803371	7	1021	This report describes a case of cognitive deterioration resulting from prolonged use of DM .
783197	0	0	Effects of ouabain on myocardial oxygen supply and demand in patients with chronic coronary artery disease .
783197	1	108	A hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic study in patients without heart failure .
783197	2	190	The effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease , but have not been measured previously in man .
783197	3	394	We assessed the effects of ouabain ( 0 . 015 mg / kg body weight ) on hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure .
783197	4	610	Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations , we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted .
783197	5	815	Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain , even though they were initially elevated in only two patients .
783197	6	996	Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure fell from 11 . 5 + / - 1 . 4 ( mean + / - SE ) to 5 . 6 + / - 0 . 9 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell from 100 + / - 17 to 82 + / - 12 ml / m2 ( P less than 0 . 01 ) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed .
783197	7	1247	The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1 . 68 + / - 0 . 11 ml / s to 2 . 18 + / - 0 . 21 muscle - lengths / s ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and is consistent with an increase in contractility .
783197	8	1438	No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients .
783197	9	1514	No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients .
783197	10	1733	We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end - diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal .
783197	11	1955	Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension , and , therefore , of myocardial oxygen consumption , it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption .
783197	12	2173	Nevertheless , compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism .
7843916	0	0	Dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension in perfusion - cultured human eyes .
7843916	1	76	PURPOSE : Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of ocular hypertension and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility .
7843916	2	282	The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes .
7843916	3	443	METHODS : The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow , variable pressure perfusion culture system .
7843916	4	594	Paired eyes were perfused in serum - free media with or without 10 ( - 7 ) M dexamethasone for 12 days .
7843916	5	692	Intraocular pressure was monitored daily .
7843916	6	734	After incubation , the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy , transmission and scanning electron microscopy , and scanning laser confocal microscopy .
7843916	7	904	RESULTS : A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with dexamethasone with an average pressure rise of 17 . 5 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg after 12 days of dexamethasone exposure .
7843916	8	1121	The contralateral control eyes , which did not receive dexamethasone , maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period .
7843916	9	1255	The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal .
7843916	10	1330	In contrast , the dexamethasone - treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams , decreased intertrabecular spaces , thickened juxtacanalicular tissue , activated trabecular meshwork cells , and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material , especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm .
7843916	11	1692	The dexamethasone - treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes , although several subtle dexamethasone - induced morphologic changes were evident .
7843916	12	1878	CONCLUSION : Dexamethasone treatment of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30 % of the dexamethasone - treated eyes .
7843916	13	2058	Steroid treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and open angle glaucoma .
7843916	14	2214	This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in steroid glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma .
7880714	0	0	Auditory disturbance associated with interscalene brachial plexus block .
7880714	1	73	We performed an audiometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an interscalene brachial plexus block ( IBPB ) .
7880714	2	219	Bupivacaine 0 . 75 % with adrenaline was given followed by a 24 - hr continuous infusion of 0 . 25 % bupivacaine .
7880714	3	325	Three audiometric threshold measurements ( 0 . 25 - 18 kHz ) were made : the first before IBPB , the second 2 - 6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation .
7880714	4	493	In four patients hearing impairment on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation , in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day .
7880714	5	665	The frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients ; in one only low frequencies ( 0 . 25 - 0 . 5 kHz ) were involved .
7880714	6	797	The maximum change in threshold was 35 dB at 6 kHz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of bupivacaine .
7880714	7	911	This patient had hearing threshold changes ( 15 - 20 dB ) at 6 - 10 kHz on the opposite side also .
7880714	8	1004	IBPB may cause transient auditory dysfunction in the ipsilateral ear , possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation .
7905523	0	0	The safety and efficacy of combination N - butyl - deoxynojirimycin ( SC - 48334 ) and zidovudine in patients with HIV - 1 infection and 200 - 500 CD4 cells / mm3 .
7905523	1	150	We conducted a double - blind , randomized phase II study to evaluate the safety and activity of combination therapy with N - butyl - deoxynojirimycin ( SC - 48334 ) ( an alpha - glucosidase I inhibitor ) and zidovudine versus zidovudine alone .
7905523	2	380	Patients with 200 to 500 CD4 cells / mm3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior zidovudine therapy received SC - 48334 ( 1000 mg every 8 h ) and zidovudine ( 100 mg every 8 h ) or zidovudine and placebo .
7905523	3	576	Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58 , zidovudine and placebo .
7905523	4	652	Twenty - three patients ( 38 % ) and 15 ( 26 % ) , in the combination and zidovudine groups , respectively , discontinued therapy ( p = 0 . 15 ) .
7905523	5	783	The mean SC - 48334 steady - state trough level ( 4 . 04 + / - 0 . 99 micrograms / ml ) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
7905523	6	945	The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 4 was 73 . 8 cells / mm3 and 52 . 4 cells / mm3 for the combination and zidovudine groups , respectively ( p > 0 . 36 ) .
7905523	7	1092	For patients with prior zidovudine therapy , the mean change in CD4 cells in the combination and zidovudine groups was 63 . 7 cells / mm3 and 4 . 9 cells / mm3 at week 8 and 6 . 8 cells / mm3 and - 45 . 1 cells / mm3 at week 16 , respectively .
7905523	8	1317	The number of patients with suppression of HIV p24 antigenemia in the combination and zidovudine groups was six ( 40 % ) and two ( 11 % ) at week 4 ( p = 0 . 10 ) and five ( 45 % ) and two ( 14 % ) at week 24 ( p = 0 . 08 ) , respectively .
7905523	9	1536	Diarrhea , flatulence , abdominal pain , and weight loss were common for combination recipients . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
7910951	0	0	Prolonged paralysis due to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids .
7910951	1	94	The long - term use of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents ( ND - NMBA ) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged muscle weakness , although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear .
7910951	2	321	We report 3 patients ( age 37 - 52 years ) with acute respiratory insufficiency who developed prolonged weakness following the discontinuation of ND - NMBAs .
7910951	3	473	Two patients also received intravenous corticosteroids .
7910951	4	529	Renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients , and all had acidosis .
7910951	5	628	Electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials , normal sensory studies , and fibrillations .
7910951	6	755	Repetitive stimulation at 2 Hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients .
7910951	7	831	The serum vecuronium level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng / mL .
7910951	8	940	A muscle biopsy in this patient showed loss of thick , myosin filaments .
7910951	9	1012	The weakness in these patients is due to pathology at both the neuromuscular junction ( most likely due to ND - NMBA ) and muscle ( most likely due to corticosteroids ) .
7910951	10	1176	Hepatic dysfunction and acidosis are contributing risk factors .
8012887	0	0	Failure of ancrod in the treatment of heparin - induced arterial thrombosis .
8012887	1	75	The morbidity and mortality associated with heparin - induced thrombosis remain high despite numerous empirical therapies .
8012887	2	196	Ancrod has been used successfully for prophylaxis against development of thrombosis in patients with heparin induced platelet aggregation who require brief reexposure to heparin , but its success in patients who have developed the thrombosis syndrome is not well defined .
8012887	3	467	The authors present a case of failure of ancrod treatment in a patient with heparin - induced thrombosis .
803783	0	0	Water intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline - induced abortion .
803783	1	91	Four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline - induced abortions are described .
803783	2	214	The mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases .
803783	3	289	Oxytocin administration during midtrimester - induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff , aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia , muscular irritability , or headaches .
803783	4	623	The oxytocin should be given only in Ringers lactate or , alternately , in Ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions .
803783	5	759	The urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases .
803783	6	911	The oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours .
803783	7	974	If the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance .
804391	0	0	Light chain proteinuria and cellular mediated immunity in rifampin treated patients with tuberculosis .
804391	1	103	Light chain proteinuria was found in 9 of 17 tuberculosis patients treated with rifampin .
804391	2	193	Concomitant assay of cellular mediated immunity in these patients using skin test antigen and a lymphokine in vitro test provided results that were different .
804391	3	352	Response to Varidase skin test antigen was negative for all eight tuberculosis patients tested , but there occurred a hyper - responsiveness of the lymphocytes of these eight patients to phytomitogen ( PHA - P ) . as well as of those of seven other tuberculous patients .
804391	4	615	This last finding may be related to time of testing and / or endogenous serum binding of rifampin which could have inhibited mitogen activity for the lymphocyte .
8045270	0	0	KF17837 : a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist with anticataleptic activity .
8045270	1	91	KF17837 is a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist .
8045270	2	155	Oral administration of KF17837 ( 2 . 5 , 10 . 0 and 30 . 0 mg / kg ) significantly ameliorated the cataleptic responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an adenosine A2A receptor agonist , CGS 21680 ( 10 micrograms ) , in a dose - dependent manner .
8045270	3	407	KF17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol ( 1 mg / kg i . p . ) and by reserpine ( 5 mg / kg i . p . ) .
8045270	4	513	These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0 . 625 and 2 . 5 mg / kg p . o . , respectively .
8045270	5	628	Moreover , KF17837 ( 0 . 625 mg / kg p . o . ) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of L - 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L - DOPA ; 25 mg / kg i . p . ) plus benserazide ( 6 . 25 mg / kg i . p . ) .
8045270	6	819	These results suggested that KF17837 is a centrally active adenosine A2A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by adenosine A2A receptor antagonists .
8045270	7	1030	Furthermore , KF17837 may be a useful drug in the treatment of parkinsonism .
8106150	0	0	Effect of nondopaminergic drugs on L - dopa - induced dyskinesias in MPTP - treated monkeys .
8106150	1	87	A group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin MPTP .
8106150	2	158	They were then treated chronically with L - DOPA / benserazide 50 / 12 . 5 mg / kg given orally daily for 2 months .
8106150	3	264	This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect , but all animals manifested dyskinesia .
8106150	4	358	A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L - DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified .
8106150	5	533	Several drugs , including clonidine , physostigmine , methysergide , 5 - MDOT , propranolol , and MK - 801 , markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology .
8106150	6	733	However , yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements .
8106150	7	815	Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia .
8106150	8	898	Atropine converted the dystonic movements into chorea .
8111719	0	0	Hallucinations and ifosfamide - induced neurotoxicity .
8111719	1	53	BACKGROUND : Hallucinations as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of ifosfamide .
8111719	2	178	Most cases of ifosfamide - induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes .
8111719	3	279	METHODS : The authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide - induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium .
8111719	4	401	All patients were receiving high - dose ifosfamide as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure .
8111719	5	501	RESULTS : Hallucinations occurred only when the patient ' s eyes were closed and , in all but one case , were reported as disturbing or frightening .
8111719	6	645	Underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely .
8111719	7	707	CONCLUSIONS : Hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity .
8111719	8	792	The incidence may be dose and infusion - time related .
8111719	9	845	The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide - induced hallucinations , which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity . " Eyes - closed " hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation .
8111719	10	1073	Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence .
8111719	11	1173	Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear .
8111719	12	1240	If agitation becomes marked , high - potency neuroleptics ( i . e . , haloperidol ) may be effective .
8251368	0	0	Photodistributed nifedipine - induced facial telangiectasia .
8251368	1	59	Five months after starting nifedipine ( Adalat ) , two patients developed photodistributed facial telangiectasia , which became more noticeable with time .
8251368	2	210	Neither patient complained of photosensitivity or flushing .
8251368	3	270	Both patients reported a significant cosmetic improvement after discontinuing the drug .
8251368	4	358	One commenced the closely related drug amlodipine 3 years later , with recurrence of telangiectasia .
8251368	5	458	The photodistribution of the telangiectasia suggests a significant drug / light interaction .
8267029	0	0	Penicillamine - induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis .
8267029	1	101	A 67 - year - old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis ( RPGN ) after 5 months of D - penicillamine ( 250 mg / day ) treatment .
8267029	2	261	Light microscopy study showed severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation in 60 % of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole .
8267029	3	433	Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG , IgA and C3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium .
8267029	4	543	The patient was treated with steroid pulse , plasmapheresis , cyclophosphamide and antiplatelet agents .
8267029	5	645	A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks .
8267029	6	712	This new case of RPGN in the course of D - penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patients .
8267029	7	909	The prompt discontinuation of D - penicillamine and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case .
8268147	0	0	A case of polymyositis in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis treated with D - penicillamine .
8268147	1	97	Although D - penicillamine has been used for many rheumatologic diseases , toxicity limits its usefulness in many patients .
8268147	2	218	Polymyositis / dermatomyositis can develop as one of the autoimmune complications of D - penicillamine treatment , but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear .
8268147	3	372	We report a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis , who developed polymyositis while receiving D - penicillamine therapy .
8268147	4	492	We described the special clinical course of the patient .
8268147	5	549	Patients receiving D - penicillamine therapy should be followed carefully for the development of autoimmune complications like polymyositis / dermatomyositis .
8278214	0	0	Hyperalgesia and myoclonus in terminal cancer patients treated with continuous intravenous morphine .
8278214	1	101	Eight cancer patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous morphine developed hyperalgesia .
8278214	2	233	All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen .
8278214	3	318	Five patients developed universal hyperalgesia and hyperesthesia which in 2 cases were accompanied by myoclonus .
8278214	4	431	In 3 patients a pre - existing neuralgia increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases myoclonus occurred simultaneously .
8278214	5	565	Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between hyperalgesia / myoclonus and high doses of morphine are available , experimental support from animal studies indicates that morphine , or its metabolites , plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome .
8278214	6	846	The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations .

8305357	1	71	We report a non - randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal daunorubicin ( DaunoXome ) in the treatment of AIDS related Kaposi ' s sarcoma .
8305357	2	245	Eleven homosexual men with advanced Kaposi ' s sarcoma were entered in the trial .
8305357	3	325	Changes in size , colour and associated oedema of selected ' target ' lesions were measured .
8305357	4	415	Clinical , biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed .
8305357	5	482	Ten subjects were evaluated .
8305357	6	511	A partial response was achieved in four , of whom two subsequently relapsed .
8305357	7	587	Stabilization of Kaposi ' s sarcoma occurred in the remaining six , maintained until the end of the trial period in four .
8305357	8	706	The drug was generally well tolerated , with few mild symptoms of toxicity .
8305357	9	781	The main problem encountered was haematological toxicity , with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count < 0 . 5 x 10 ( 9 ) / l ) .
8305357	10	927	There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity .
8305357	11	968	In this small patient sample , liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of Kaposi ' s sarcoma .
8384253	0	0	Long - term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system .
8384253	1	67	Forty patients with Non - Hodgkin ' s Lymphoma treated with vincristine between 1984 and 1990 ( cumulative dose 12 mg in 18 - 24 weeks ) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system .
8384253	2	306	The patients were interviewed with emphasis on neuropathic symptoms .
8384253	3	375	Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed , four to 77 months ( median 34 months ) after vincristine treatment .
8384253	4	584	Twenty - seven patients reported neuropathic symptoms .
8384253	5	637	In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination .
8384253	6	720	In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated .
8384253	7	779	In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past .
8384253	8	843	Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy .
8384253	9	910	There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination .
8384253	10	1011	Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients .
8384253	11	1064	Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term .
8384253	12	1131	It is concluded that with the above mentioned vincristine dose schedule signs and symptoms of vincristine neuropathy are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good .
839274	0	0	Hepatic adenomas and focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver in young women on oral contraceptives : case reports .
839274	1	113	Two cases of hepatic adenoma and one of focal nodular hyperplasia presumably associated with the use of oral contraceptives , are reported .
839274	2	252	Special reference is made to their clinical presentation , which may be totally asymptomatic .
839274	3	345	Liver - function tests are of little diagnostic value , but valuable information may be obtained from both liver scanning and hepatic angiography .
839274	4	489	Histologic differences and clinical similarities between hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver are discussed .
8410199	0	0	Loss of glutamate decarboxylase mRNA - containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following pilocarpine - induced seizures .
8410199	1	121	In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) mRNA - containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to seizure - induced damage in a model of chronic seizures .
8410199	2	346	Sprague - Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine , and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine - induced seizures .
8410199	3	542	In situ hybridization histochemistry , using a digoxigenin - labeled GAD cRNA probe , demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the pilocarpine - treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals .
8410199	4	818	Additional neuronanatomical studies , including cresyl violet staining , neuronal degeneration methods , and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein , suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels .
8410199	5	1135	The loss of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer .
8410199	6	1313	Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals .
8410199	7	1565	No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer , which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer .
8410199	8	1734	The results indicate that , in this model , a subpopulation of GAD mRNA - containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure - induced damage .
8410199	9	1901	Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of GABA neurons .
8424298	0	0	Effects of deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane on neuropsychological function .
8424298	1	103	The effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients .
8424298	2	229	Twenty - four patients were anaesthetized for middle - ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane ( hypotensive group ) .
8424298	3	378	Seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group .
8424298	4	444	The mean arterial pressure was 77 + / - 2 mmHg ( 10 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 kPa ) before hypotension and 50 + / - 0 mmHg ( 6 . 7 + / - 0 . 0 kPa ) during hypotension in the hypotensive group , and 86 + / - 2 mmHg ( 11 . 5 + / - 0 . 3 kPa ) during anaesthesia in the control group .
8424298	5	686	The following psychological tests were performed : four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( similarities , digit span , vocabulary and digit symbol ) , Trail - Making tests A and B , Zung tests ( self - rating anxiety scale and self - rating depression scale ) and two - part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall .
8424298	6	1016	The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively .
8424298	7	1084	There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value .
8424298	8	1238	The results indicate that hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia .
8441146	0	0	Apparent cure of rheumatoid arthritis by bone marrow transplantation .
8441146	1	70	We describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) by bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) in 2 patients .
8441146	2	234	BMT was used to treat severe aplastic anemia which was caused by gold in one case and D - penicillamine in the other .
8441146	3	350	In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants ( representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy , respectively ) , the RA in each case has been completely quiescent .
8441146	4	537	Although short term remission of severe RA following BMT has been reported , these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available .
8441146	5	688	This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive synovitis .
8473723	0	0	Seizures induced by combined levomepromazine - fluvoxamine treatment .
8473723	1	68	We report a case of combined levomepromazine - fluvoxamine treatment - induced seizures .
8473723	2	153	It seems that combined treatment of fluvoxamine with phenothiazines may possess proconvulsive activity .
8475949	0	0	Case report : pentamidine and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia revisited .
8475949	1	76	Pentamidine isethionate has been associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias , including torsade de pointes .
8475949	2	185	This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date .
8475949	3	277	Pentamidine - induced torsade de pointes may be related to serum magnesium levels and hypomagnesemia may synergistically induce torsade .
8475949	4	412	Torsade de pointes occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with pentamidine .
8475949	5	499	In these patients , no other acute side effects of pentamidine were observed .
8475949	6	576	Torsade de pointes can be treated when recognized early , possibly without discontinuation of pentamidine .
8475949	7	682	When QTc interval prolongation is observed , early magnesium supplementation is advocated .
8480959	0	0	Efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in 3390 women with moderate hypercholesterolemia .
8480959	1	90	OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in women with moderate hypercholesterolemia .
8480959	2	196	DESIGN : The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin ( EXCEL ) Study , a multicenter , double - blind , diet - and placebo - controlled trial , in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily , or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks .
8480959	3	486	SETTING : Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States .
8480959	4	584	PATIENTS : Women ( n = 3390 ) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers .
8480959	5	653	MEASUREMENTS : Plasma total , low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , and high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , and triglycerides ; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study .
8480959	6	879	RESULTS : Among women , lovastatin ( 20 to 80 mg / d ) produced sustained ( 12 - to 48 - week ) , dose - related changes ( P < 0 . 001 ) : decreases in LDL cholesterol ( 24 % to 40 % ) and triglycerides ( 9 % to 18 % ) , and increases in HDL cholesterol ( 6 . 7 % to 8 . 6 % ) .
8480959	7	1121	Depending on the dose , from 82 % to 95 % of lovastatin - treated women achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program goal of LDL cholesterol levels less than 4 . 14 mmol / L ( 160 mg / dL ) , and 40 % to 87 % achieved the goal of 3 . 36 mmol / L ( 130 mg / dL ) .
8480959	8	1367	Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0 . 1 % of women and were dose dependent above the 20 - mg dose .
8480959	9	1525	Myopathy , defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal , was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of lovastatin ( 80 mg ) .
8480959	10	1730	Estrogen - replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of lovastatin .
8480959	11	1842	CONCLUSION : Lovastatin is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary hypercholesterolemia in women .
8492347	0	0	Tetany and rhabdomyolysis due to surreptitious furosemide - - importance of magnesium supplementation .
8492347	1	100	Diuretics may induce hypokalemia , hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia .
8492347	2	167	While severe hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness , severe hypomagnesemia is associated with muscle spasms and tetany which cannot be corrected by potassium and calcium supplementation alone ( 1 , 2 ) .
8492347	3	365	Surreptitious diuretic ingestion has been described , mainly in women who are concerned that they are obese or edematous .
8492347	4	486	Symptomatic hypokalemia has been reported in such patients ( 3 - 7 ) and in one case hypocalcemia was observed ( 8 ) , but the effects of magnesium depletion were not noted in these patients .
8494478	0	0	Ciprofloxacin - induced nephrotoxicity in patients with cancer .
8494478	1	62	Nephrotoxicity associated with ciprofloxacin is uncommon .
8494478	2	120	Five patients with cancer who developed acute renal failure that followed treatment with ciprofloxacin are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed .
8494478	3	305	Other than elevation of serum creatinine levels , characteristic clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory findings are not frequently present .
8494478	4	454	Allergic interstitial nephritis is believed to be the underlying pathological - process .
8494478	5	541	Definitive diagnosis requires performance of renal biopsy , although this is not always feasible .
8494478	6	638	An improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of ciprofloxacin - induced acute renal failure .
8514073	0	0	Venous complications of midazolam versus diazepam .
8514073	1	51	Although some studies have suggested fewer venous complications are associated with midazolam than with diazepam for endoscopic procedures , this variable has not been well documented .
8514073	2	235	We prospectively evaluated the incidence of venous complications after intravenous injection of diazepam or midazolam in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy .
8514073	3	436	Overall , venous complications were more frequent with diazepam ( 22 of 62 patients ) than with midazolam ( 4 of 60 patients ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
8514073	4	571	A palpable venous cord was present in 23 % ( 14 of 62 ) of patients in the diazepam group , compared with 2 % ( 1 of 60 patients ) in the midazolam group ( p < 0 . 002 ) .
8514073	5	731	Pain at the injection site occurred in 35 % ( 22 of 62 ) of patients in the diazepam group compared with 7 % ( 4 of 60 patients ) in the midazolam group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
8514073	6	891	Swelling and warmth at the injection site were not significantly different between the two groups .
8514073	7	990	Smoking , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug use , intravenous catheter site , dwell time of the needle , alcohol use , and pain during the injection had no effect on the incidence of venous complications .
8546130	0	0	Clarithromycin - associated visual hallucinations in a patient with chronic renal failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis .
8546130	1	134	Visual hallucinations are a rare event in chronic renal failure and not related to uremia per se .
8546130	2	232	Unreported in the literature is visual hallucinations occurring in association with the new macrolide antibiotic , clarithromycin .
8546130	3	362	We describe such a case in a patient with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) .
8546130	4	499	The combination of a relatively high dose of clarithromycin in face of chronic renal failure in a functionally anephric patient , with underlying aluminum intoxication , may have facilitated the appearance of this neurotoxic side effect .
8546130	5	735	It is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of medications in face of chronic renal failure , the possibility of drug interactions , and how these factors should help guide medication therapy in the ESRD patient .
85485	0	0	Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and hepatoma of mice induced by alpha - benzene hexachloride .
85485	1	106	Peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha - benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically .
85485	2	290	Although most of the hepatomas were well - differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes , the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes .
85485	3	514	At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding , hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages .
85485	4	616	A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes .
85485	5	734	Within the nodules , foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared .
85485	6	859	These cells proliferated further , replacing the most part of the nodules , and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed .
85485	7	995	No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats .
8586822	0	0	Contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to salt - sensitivity in lifetime captopril - treated spontaneously hypertensive rats .
8586822	1	130	OBJECTIVE : To test the hypothesis that , in lifetime captopril - treated spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) , the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the hypertensive effect of dietary sodium chloride supplementation .
8586822	2	365	METHODS : Male SHR ( aged 6 weeks ) that had been treated from conception onward with either captopril or vehicle remained on a basal sodium chloride diet or were fed a high sodium chloride diet .
8586822	3	558	After 2 weeks , the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later , an infusion of clonidine .
8586822	4	664	RESULTS : Lifetime captopril treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups .
8586822	5	763	Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the dietary sodium chloride - induced increase in MAP in both groups .
8586822	6	943	Infusion of the central nervous system alpha2 - adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high ( compared with the basal ) sodium chloride diet .
8586822	7	1164	CONCLUSIONS : In both lifetime captopril - treated and control SHR , the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the pressor effects of a high sodium chloride diet .
8599504	0	0	Angioedema associated with droperidol administration .
8599504	1	54	Angioedema , also known as angioneurotic edema or Quincke ' s disease , is a well - demarcated , localized edema involving the subcutaneous tissues that may cause upper - airway obstruction .
8599504	2	236	We report the case of a previously healthy 19 - year - old man with no known drug allergies in whom angioedema with significant tongue swelling and protrusion developed within 10 minutes of the administration of a single IV dose of droperidol .
8600333	0	0	Late cardiotoxicity after treatment for a malignant bone tumor .
8600333	1	64	Cardiac function was assessed in long - term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to Rosen ' s T5 or T10 protocol , both including doxorubicin .
8600333	2	228	Thirty - one patients , age 10 - 45 years ( median age 17 . 8 years ) were evaluated 2 . 3 - 14 . 1 years ( median 8 . 9 years ) following completion of treatment .
8600333	3	373	Cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225 - 550 mg / m2 ( median dose 360 ) .
8600333	4	443	The evaluation consisted of a history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , signal averaged ECG , 24 - hour ambulatory ECG , echocardiography and radionuclide angiography .
8600333	5	621	Eighteen of 31 ( 58 % ) patients showed cardiac toxicity , defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities : late potentials , complex ventricular arrhythmias , left ventricular dilation , decreased shortening fraction , or decreased ejection fraction .
8600333	6	878	The incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow - up ( P < or = . 05 ) .
8600333	7	967	No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status , except for heart rate variability .
8600333	8	1098	When adjusted to body surface area , the left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( LVPW index ) was decreased in all patients .
8600333	9	1224	The incidence of doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow - up , irrespective of cumulative dose .
8600333	10	1347	Life - long cardiac follow - up in these patients is warranted .
8600333	11	1407	The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for cardiotoxicity .
8607407	0	0	Acute blood pressure elevations with caffeine in men with borderline systemic hypertension .
8607407	1	92	Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated .
8607407	2	205	Thus , caffeine ( 3 . 3 mg / kg ) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men ( aged 20 to 35 years ) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions .
8607407	3	348	Borderline hypertensive men ( n = 24 ) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure ( BP ) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and / or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg .
8607407	4	499	Low - risk controls ( n = 24 ) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening BP < 130 / 85 mm Hg .
8607407	5	608	Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12 - hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols ; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits .
8607407	6	762	Caffeine - induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls ( + 8 . 4 vs + 3 . 8 mm Hg , p < 0 . 0001 ) , and were attributable to larger changes in impedance - derived measures of systemic vascular resistance ( + 135 vs + 45 dynes . s . cm - 5 , p < 0 . 004 ) .
8607407	7	1043	These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols .
8607407	8	1118	The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96 % .
8607407	9	1231	Consequently , whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline , 33 % of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion .
8607407	10	1422	Thus , in borderline hypertensive men , exaggerated responses to caffeine were : selective for diastolic BP , consistent with greater vasoconstriction , replicated in 2 protocols , and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives .
8607407	11	1656	We suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression , as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment .
8617710	0	0	Absence of effect of sertraline on time - based sensitization of cognitive impairment with haloperidol .
8617710	1	102	This double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study evaluated the effects of haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus sertraline on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjects .
8617710	2	300	METHOD : All subjects received placebo on Day 1 and haloperidol 2 mg on Days 2 and 25 .
8617710	3	386	From Days 9 to 25 , subjects were randomly assigned to either sertraline ( 12 subjects ) or placebo ( 12 subjects ) ; the sertraline dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg / day from Days 9 to 16 , and remained at 200 mg / day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period .
8617710	4	656	Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24 - hour period after dosing on Days 1 , 2 , and 25 .
8617710	5	772	RESULTS : Impairment of cognitive function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing .
8617710	6	928	When single - dose haloperidol was given again 25 days later , greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups , suggesting enhancement of this effect .
8617710	7	1118	There was no indication that sertraline exacerbated the impairment produced by haloperidol since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group .
8617710	8	1272	Three subjects ( 2 on sertraline and 1 on placebo ) withdrew from the study because of side effects .
8617710	9	1371	Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment .
8617710	10	1442	The side effect profiles of sertraline and of placebo were similar .
8617710	11	1510	CONCLUSION : Haloperidol produced a clear profile of cognitive impairment that was not worsened by concomitant sertraline administration .
8638876	0	0	Coexistence of cerebral venous sinus and internal carotid artery thrombosis associated with exogenous sex hormones .
8638876	1	116	A case report .
8638876	2	131	A forty - six year - old premenopausal woman developed headache , nausea and vomiting , left hemiparesis and seizure two days after parenteral use of progesterone and estradiol .
8638876	3	303	Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) was found during admission .
8638876	4	354	Computed tomography showed a hemorrhagic infarct in the right frontal lobe and increased density in the superior sagittal sinus ( SSS ) .
8638876	5	489	Left carotid angiography found occlusion of the left internal carotid artery ( ICA ) .
8638876	6	573	Right carotid angiograms failed to show the SSS and inferior sagittal sinus , suggestive of venous sinus thrombosis .
8638876	7	689	Coexistence of the cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion has been described infrequently .
8638876	8	788	In this case , the authors postulate that the use of estradiol and progesterone and the underlying DM increased vascular thrombogenicity , which provided a common denominator for thrombosis of both the ICA and the venous sinus .
8643966	0	0	Chemotherapy of advanced inoperable non - small cell lung cancer with paclitaxel : a phase II trial .
8643966	1	98	Paclitaxel ( Taxol ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different tumor types , notably ovarian and breast carcinoma .
8643966	2	284	Two phase II trials of 24 - hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy - naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) reported response rates of 21 % and 24 % .
8643966	3	464	Leukopenia was dose limiting : as many as 62 . 5 % of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia .
8643966	4	555	We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3 - hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC .
8643966	5	701	The 58 patients treated ( 41 men and 17 women ) had a median age of 59 years ( age range , 25 to 75 ) and a performance status of 0 through 2 .
8643966	6	839	Most patients ( 72 . 4 % ) had stage IV NSCLC .
8643966	7	881	Paclitaxel 225 mg / m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication .
8643966	8	983	Of 50 patients evaluable for response , 12 ( 24 % ) had partial remission , 26 ( 52 % ) had no change , and 12 had disease progression ( 24 % ) .
8643966	9	1116	Hematologic toxicities were mild : only one patient ( 2 % ) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , while 29 % had grade 1 or 2 .
8643966	10	1236	Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56 % of patients while only one ( 2 % ) experienced severe polyneuropathy .
8643966	11	1344	Similarly , grade 1 or 2 myalgia / arthralgia was observed in 63 . 2 % of patients , but only 14 . 3 % experienced grade 3 or 4 .
8643966	12	1463	Nausea and vomiting were infrequent , with 14 % of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2 % experiencing grade 3 or 4 .
8643966	13	1586	Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population , with a 3 - hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24 - hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity .
8643966	14	1813	Further phase II studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against NSCLC are indicated , and phase III studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed .
8643973	0	0	Paclitaxel combined with carboplatin in the first - line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer .
8643973	1	93	In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel ( Taxol ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) given as a 3 - hour infusion in combination with carboplatin administered every 21 days to women with advanced ovarian cancer , paclitaxel doses were escalated as follows : level 1 , 135 mg / m2 ; level 2 , 160 mg / m2 ; level 3 , 185 mg / m2 ; and level 4 , 210 mg / m2 .
8643973	2	471	The fixed dose of carboplatin at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) of 5 using the Calvert formula .
8643973	3	625	In levels 5 and 6 the carboplatin dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7 . 5 , respectively , combined with a fixed paclitaxel dose of 185 mg / m2 .
8643973	4	765	To date , 30 previously untreated patients , all with a good performance status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2 ) have been entered into this ongoing study .
8643973	5	930	The dose - limiting toxicity of the combination was myelosuppression ( leukopenia , granulocytopenia , and thrombocytopenia ) .
8643973	6	1051	Neurotoxicity was largely moderate .
8643973	7	1087	So far , 14 patients are evaluable for response ; of these , eight ( 57 % ) showed objective ( complete or partial ) response and disease stabilized in six patients .
8643973	8	1245	No patient had disease progression .
8643973	9	1281	We conclude that the combination of paclitaxel 185 mg / m2 administered as a 3 - hour infusion followed immediately by a 1 - hour infusion of carboplatin at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21 - day schedule in the outpatient setting .
8643973	10	1519	The recommended dose for phase III studies is paclitaxel 185 mg / m2 and carboplatin AUC 6 .
8665051	0	0	Effects of acute steroid administration on ventilatory and peripheral muscles in rats .
8665051	1	87	Occasional case reports have shown that acute myopathy may occur in patients treated with massive doses of corticosteroids .
8665051	2	211	The mechanism of this myopathy is poorly understood .
8665051	3	264	Therefore , 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline ( C ) , methylprednisolone ( M ) , or triamcinolone ( T ) 80 mg / kg / d for 5 d . Nutritional intake , measured daily in 15 animals , showed a significant reduction of food intake in the steroid - treated groups ( - 50 and - 79 % in M and T , respectively ) .
8665051	4	585	This was associated with a similar loss in body weight .
8665051	5	641	In the 45 remaining animals , diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied .
8665051	6	756	Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after steroid treatment .
8665051	7	852	Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group ( 653 + / - 174 g / cm ( 2 ) ) than in the M group ( 837 + / - 171 g / cm ( 2 ) ; p < 0 . 05 ) and the T group ( 765 + / - 145 g / cm ( 2 ) , NS ) .
8665051	8	1029	Half - relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups , and time to peak tension was longer with M , whereas tetanic tensions were similar .
8665051	9	1171	Steroid treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force - frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
8665051	10	1312	ATPase staining of the diaphragm , scalenus medius , and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa atrophy with T , whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis .
8665051	11	1574	Finally , a pair - fed ( PF ) study , performed in 18 rats ( C , T , and PF ) , showed that muscle atrophy was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in T - treated animals .
8665051	12	1744	We conclude that ( 1 ) short - term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting ; ( 2 ) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb atrophy , resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties ; ( 3 ) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis ; ( 4 ) type IIb atrophy was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone .
8677458	0	0	Continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna to prevent ifosfamide - induced hemorrhagic cystitis .
8677458	1	100	Hemorrhagic cystitis is a major potential toxicity of ifosfamide that can be prevented by administering mesna along with the cytotoxic agent .
8677458	2	242	Mesna is generally administered by the intravenous route , although experience with oral delivery of the drug has increased .
8677458	3	366	The continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access .
8677458	4	473	In addition , subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary mesna concentrations , such as in a patient taking oral mesna who experiences severe ifosfamide - induced emesis and is unable to absorb the drug .
8677458	5	737	Limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous mesna administration suggests it is a safe , practical , and economic method of drug delivery that permits ifosfamide to be administered successfully in the outpatient setting .
8686832	0	0	Leg and back pain after spinal anaesthesia involving hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine .
8686832	1	79	Fifty - four patients , aged 27 - 90 years , who were given lignocaine 5 % in 6 . 8 % glucose solution for spinal anaesthesia were studied .
8686832	2	209	Thirteen of these patients experienced pain in the legs and / or back after recovery from anaesthesia .
8686832	3	310	The patients affected were younger ( p < 0 . 05 ) and the site of the dural puncture was higher ( p < 0 . 01 ) than those individuals without pain .
8686832	4	450	Five of the 13 patients ( 38 % ) with pain and seven of the 41 patients ( 17 % ) without pain admitted to a high alcohol intake , which might be a contributing factor .
8686832	5	611	Leg and / or back pain is associated with the intrathecal use of hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine .
871943	0	0	The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea .
871943	1	59	Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours after succinylcholine have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase .
871943	2	232	Adequate spontaneous respiration was re - established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection .
871943	3	341	In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase .
871943	4	449	In three patients none of the usual variants were found .
871943	5	506	It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze succinylcholine .
871943	6	629	The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist .
873132	0	0	Increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha - hydroxylation of deoxycholic acid in ethinyl estradiol - induced cholestasis in rats .
873132	1	125	Deoxycholic acid conjugation , transport capacity , and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol - treated rats .
873132	2	251	Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid , and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment .
873132	3	414	During [ 24 - 14C ] sodium deoxycholate infusion , [ 14C ] biliary bile acid secretion increased , but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or ethinyl estradiol - treated rats .
873132	4	599	Ethinyl estradiol - treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals , consistent with an impairment of 7alpha - hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid .
873132	5	791	Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid , but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1 . 5 % in controls to nearly 4 . 0 % ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .
873132	6	992	These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species .
873132	7	1129	Furthermore , the rat converts deoxycholic acid , a poor choleretic , to taurocholic acid , a good choleretic .
873132	8	1236	When this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment , sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid .
8742498	0	0	Influence of diet free of NAD - precursors on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mice .
8742498	1	82	Recently , we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of nicotinic acid amide , a selective inhibitor of poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ; EC 2 . 4 . 2 . 30 ) on mice suffering from acetaminophen ( AAP ) - hepatitis , suggesting that the AAP - induced liver injury involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation .
8742498	2	386	The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of NAD , the substrate on which PARP acts , in female NMRI mice with AAP hepatitis and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals .
8742498	3	621	Liver injuries were quantified as serum activities of glutamate - oxaloacetate transaminase ( GOT ) and glutamate - pyruvate transaminase ( GPT ) .
8742498	4	760	While AAP caused a 117 - fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet , which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by nicotinic acid amide ( NAA ) , adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of NAD .
8742498	5	1043	In these animals , only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of AAP , and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a standard diet , the liver damage was inhibited by 50 % by ethanol .
8742498	6	1277	A further 64 % reduction of hepatitis was observed , when NAA was given to ethanol / AAP - mice .
8742498	7	1368	Our results provide evidence that the AAP - induced hepatitis and its exacerbation by ethanol can either be reduced by end - product inhibition of PARP by NAA or by dietary depletion of the enzyme ' s substrate NAD .
8742498	8	1578	We see the main application of NAA as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of acetaminophen in order to avoid hepatic damage in patients treated with this widely used analgesic .
8766220	0	0	Nightmares and hallucinations after long - term intake of tramadol combined with antidepressants .
8766220	1	96	Tramadol is a weak opioid with effects on adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission that is used to treat cancer pain and chronic non malignant pain .
8766220	2	250	This drug was initiated in association with paroxetine and dosulepine hydrochloride in a tetraparetic patient with chronic pain .
8766220	3	379	Fifty - six days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented hallucinations that only stopped after the withdrawal of psycho - active drugs and tramadol .
8766220	4	541	The case report questions the long term use of pain killers combined with psycho - active drugs in chronic non malignant pain , especially if pain is under control .
8800187	0	0	Effect of calcium chloride and 4 - aminopyridine therapy on desipramine toxicity in rats .
8800187	1	88	BACKGROUND : Hypotension is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant overdose .
8800187	2	186	Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit calcium influx in some tissues .
8800187	3	277	This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant - induced hypotension .
8800187	4	394	METHODS : Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker overdose .
8800187	5	531	CaCl2 and 4 - aminopyridine .
8800187	6	558	Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP to produce hypotension , QRS prolongation , and bradycardia .
8800187	7	688	Fifteen min later , animals received CaCl2 , NaHCO3 , or saline .
8800187	8	750	In a second experiment , rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP followed in 15 min by 4 - aminopyridine or saline .
8800187	9	877	RESULTS : NaHCO3 briefly ( 5 min ) reversed hypotension and QRS prolongation .
8800187	10	952	CaCl2 and 4 - aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure .
8800187	11	1012	The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias ( p = 0 . 004 ) and seizures ( p = 0 . 03 ) in the CaCl2 group was higher than the other groups .
8800187	12	1142	CONCLUSION : The administration of CaCl2 or 4 - aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant - induced hypotension in rats .
8800187	13	1271	CaCl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity .
8800187	14	1362	These findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant - induced hypotension .
8841157	0	0	Valsartan , a new angiotensin II antagonist for the treatment of essential hypertension : a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against amlodipine .
8841157	1	155	OBJECTIVE : To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin II antagonist , valsartan , with a reference therapy , amlodipine .
8841157	2	292	METHODS : One hundred sixty - eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double - blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks .
8841157	3	503	After 8 weeks of therapy , in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled , 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy .
8841157	4	635	Patients were assessed at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks .
8841157	5	681	The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks .
8841157	6	789	Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates .
8841157	7	881	RESULTS : Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks .
8841157	8	985	Similar decreases were observed in both groups , with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed .
8841157	9	1125	For the primary variable the difference was 0 . 5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan ( p = 0 . 68 ; 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 7 to 1 . 7 ) .
8841157	10	1251	Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66 . 7 % for valsartan and 60 . 2 % for amlodipine ( p = 0 . 39 ) .
8841157	11	1340	Both treatments were well tolerated .
8841157	12	1377	The incidence of drug - related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group , particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day ( 2 . 4 % for 80 mg valsartan ; 3 . 6 % for 5 mg amlodipine ; 0 % for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine ; 14 . 3 % for 10 mg amlodipine ) .
8841157	13	1629	CONCLUSIONS : The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension .
8841157	14	1761	The results also show valsartan to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class , dihydropyridine calcium antagonists .
8854309	0	0	A measure of pupillary oscillation as a marker of cocaine - induced paranoia .
8854309	1	76	Cocaine - induced paranoia ( CIP ) remains an important drug - induced model of idiopathic paranoia for which no psychophysiologic marker has yet emerged .
8854309	2	225	Measures of pupillary oscillation were able to significantly distinguish a group of abstinent crack cocaine abusers endorsing past CIP ( n = 32 ) from another group of crack addicts who denied past CIP ( n = 29 ) .
8888541	0	0	Serotonin syndrome from venlafaxine - tranylcypromine interaction .
8888541	1	65	Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering , muscle rigidity , salivation , confusion , agitation and hyperthermia .
8888541	2	250	The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor .
8888541	3	397	Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine .
8888541	4	499	We report a venlafaxine - MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23 - y - old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression .
8888541	5	646	He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1 / 2 tab of venlafaxine .
8888541	6	734	Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities , tremors and rigidity .
8888541	7	829	He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering , myoclonic jerks , rigidity , salivation and diaphoresis .
8888541	8	985	His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light .
8888541	9	1040	Vital signs were : blood pressure 120 / 67 mm Hg , heart rate 127 / min , respiratory rate 28 / min , and temperature 97 F .
8888541	10	1154	After 180 mg of diazepam i . v . he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws .
8888541	11	1246	He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation , and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity .
8888541	12	1363	His subsequent course was remarkable for non - immune thrombocytopenia which resolved .
8888541	13	1448	The patient ' s maximal temperature was 101 . 2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units / L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis .
8888541	14	1571	His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward .
8888541	15	1645	This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis .
8911359	0	0	Cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer - - a highly aggressive disease : analysis of 12 cases .
8911359	1	95	PURPOSE : We gained knowledge of the etiology , treatment and prevention of cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer .
8911359	2	216	MATERIALS AND METHODS : The medical records of 6 men and 6 women ( mean age 55 years ) with cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer were reviewed .
8911359	3	363	RESULTS : All tumors were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell carcinoma .
8911359	4	430	Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease .
8911359	5	531	Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months .
8911359	6	614	The remaining patient with extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later .
8911359	7	727	CONCLUSIONS : Cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor is an aggressive disease .
8911359	8	808	However , long - term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for bladder tumors with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease , even when noninvasive .
8958188	0	0	A phase I clinical study of the antipurine antifolate lometrexol ( DDATHF ) given with oral folic acid .
8958188	1	102	Lometrexol is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis .
8958188	2	249	Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs , notably methotrexate .
8958188	3	413	However , the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities .
8958188	4	546	Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration , i . e . for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose .
8958188	5	741	This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation .
8958188	6	951	Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities .
8958188	7	1009	There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation .
8958188	8	1110	Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance .
8958188	9	1333	The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor .
8958188	10	1479	This information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in cancer therapy .
8988571	0	0	Fatal excited delirium following cocaine use : epidemiologic findings provide new evidence for mechanisms of cocaine toxicity .
8988571	1	126	We describe an outbreak of deaths from cocaine - induced excited delirium ( EDDs ) in Dade County , Florida between 1979 and 1990 .
8988571	2	252	From a registry of all cocaine - related deaths in Dade County , Florida , from 1969 - 1990 , 58 EDDs were compared with 125 victims of accidental cocaine overdose without excited delirium .
8988571	3	435	Compared with controls , EDDs were more frequently black , male , and younger .
8988571	4	511	They were less likely to have a low body mass index , and more likely to have died in police custody , to have received medical treatment immediately before death , to have survived for a longer period , to have developed hyperthermia , and to have died in summer months .
8988571	5	778	EDDs had concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls .
8988571	6	891	The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic cocaine use disrupts dopaminergic function and , when coupled with recent cocaine use , may precipitate agitation , delirium , aberrant thermoregulation , rhabdomyolysis , and sudden death .
9022662	0	0	Pemoline induced acute choreoathetosis : case report and review of the literature .
9022662	1	82	BACKGROUND : Pemoline is an oxazolidine derivative that is structurally different from amphetamines and used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder .
9022662	2	238	Pemoline has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute movement disorders .
9022662	3	338	The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with pemoline who experienced profound choreoathetosis .
9022662	4	453	CASE REPORT : Two , 3 - year - old male , identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of pemoline originally containing 59 tablets .
9022662	5	639	The children had a medical history significant for attention deficit disorder previously treated with methylphenidate without success .
9022662	6	774	This was their first day of pemoline therapy .
9022662	7	820	The choreoathetoid movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion .
9022662	8	886	The children gave no history of prior movement disorders and there was no family history of movement disorders .
9022662	9	998	The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the choreoathetoid movements .
9022662	10	1154	Despite treatment , the children continued to have choreoathetosis for approximately 24 hours .
9022662	11	1248	Forty - eight hours after admission , the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home .
9022662	12	1355	CONCLUSION : Pemoline associated movement disorder has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature .
9022662	13	1466	The possibility of choreoathetoid movements should be considered in patients presenting after pemoline overdose .
9041081	0	0	Effect of myopic excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy on the electrophysiologic function of the retina and optic nerve .
9041081	1	125	PURPOSE : To assess by electrophysiologic testing the effect of photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) on the retina and optic nerve .
9041081	2	253	SETTING : Eye Clinic , S . Salvatore Hospital , L ' Aquila University , Italy .
9041081	3	325	METHODS : Standard pattern electroretinograms ( P - ERGs ) and standard pattern visual evoked potentials ( P - VEPs ) were done in 25 eyes of 25 patients who had myopic PRK for an attempted correction between 5 . 00 and 15 . 00 diopters ( D ) ( mean 8 . 00 D ) .
9041081	4	568	Testing was done preoperatively and 3 , 6 , 12 , and 18 months postoperatively .
9041081	5	645	The contralateral eyes served as controls .
9041081	6	688	During the follow - up , 3 patients ( 12 % ) developed steroid - induced elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) that resolved after corticosteroid therapy was discontinued .
9041081	7	850	RESULTS : No statistically significant differences were seen between treated and control eyes nor between treated eyes preoperatively and postoperatively .
9041081	8	1004	CONCLUSION : Myopic excimer laser PRK did not seem to affect the posterior segment .
9041081	9	1087	The transient steroid - induced IOP rise did not seem to cause functional impairment .
9061311	0	0	Neutrophil superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in patients with acute liver failure .
9061311	1	93	Defects in superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production may be implicated in the high incidence of bacterial infections in patients with acute liver failure ( ALF ) .
9061311	2	256	In the present study , oxygen radical production in patients with ALF due to paracetamol overdose was compared with that of healthy volunteers .
9061311	3	399	Neutrophils from 14 ALF patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with ALF or control serum .
9061311	4	528	Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by ALF neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with ALF serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
9061311	5	713	This defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
9061311	6	796	Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in neutrophils stimulated with formyl - methionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) from a further 18 ALF patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils .
9061311	7	997	Serum C3 complement levels were significantly reduced in ALF patients compared with control subjects ( P < 0 . 0005 ) .
9061311	8	1112	These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in ALF due to paracetamol overdose , that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement , possibly connected to the complement receptor .
9067481	0	0	Cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen , adriamycin , carbon tetrachloride , chloroform and galactosamine .
9067481	1	158	In addition to its use as a stabilizer / rigidifier of membranes , cholesteryl hemisuccinate , tris salt ( CS ) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) .
9067481	2	376	To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection , we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non - hydrolyzable ether form of CS , gamma - cholesteryloxybutyric acid , tris salt ( CSE ) against acetaminophen - , adriamycin - , carbon tetrachloride - , chloroform - and galactosamine - induced toxicity .
9067481	3	705	The results of these studies demonstrated that CS - mediated protection is not selective for a particular species , organ system or toxic chemical .
9067481	4	850	A 24 - h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS ( 100mg / kg , i . p . ) , resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4 , CHCl3 , acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal ( and presumably cardiotoxic ) effect of adriamycin administration .
9067481	5	1139	Maximal CS - mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult .
9067481	6	1250	These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death .
9067481	7	1374	The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate ( in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity ) .
9067481	8	1590	However , based on the data presented , we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation .
9067481	9	1719	Our findings do suggest that CS - mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule ( non - hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS ) , whose mechanism has yet to be defined .
9098464	0	0	A murine model of adenomyosis : the effects of hyperprolactinemia induced by fluoxetine hydrochloride , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , on adenomyosis induction in Wistar albino rats .
9098464	1	192	OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluoxetine given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused hyperprolactinemia and its effects with respect to adenomyosis .
9098464	2	375	DESIGN : Fluoxetine , a serotonin reuptake inhibitor , was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce hyperprolactinemia .
9098464	3	502	The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls .
9098464	4	648	Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days .
9098464	5	772	SETTING : Marmara University School of Medicine , Department of Histology and Embryology , Zeynep Kamil Women and Children ' s Hospital .
9098464	6	904	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Serum prolactin levels , uterine histopathology .
9098464	7	975	RESULTS : The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with fluoxetine were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups .
9098464	8	1156	Histological studies revealed 11 cases of adenomyosis , all within the noncastrated group receiving fluoxetine .
9098464	9	1267	CONCLUSION : It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian steroids that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma .
9098464	10	1465	This invasion eventually progresses to adenomyosis .
9105126	0	0	Postinfarction ventricular septal defect associated with long - term steroid therapy .
9105126	1	84	Two cases of postinfarction ventricular septal rupture in patients on long - term steroid therapy are presented and the favourable outcome in both cases described .
9105126	2	246	A possible association between steroid therapy and subsequent postinfarction septal rupture is discussed .
9121607	0	0	Neuroactive steroids protect against pilocarpine - and kainic acid - induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus in mice .
9121607	1	122	Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone ( 3 alpha - hydroxy pregnane - 20 - ones ) and deoxycorticosterone ( 3 alpha - hydroxy pregnane - 21 - diol - 20 - ones ) and their 3 beta - epimers were evaluated for protective activity against pilocarpine - , kainic acid - and N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) - induced seizures in mice .
9121607	2	438	Steroids with the 3 - hydroxy group in the alpha - position and 5 - H in the alpha - or beta - configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine ( 416 mg / kg , s . c . ) - induced limbic motor seizures and status epilepticus ( ED50 values , 7 . 0 - 18 . 7 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
9121607	3	703	The corresponding epimers with the 3 - hydroxy group in the beta - position were also effective but less potent ( ED50 values , 33 . 8 - 63 . 5 , i . p . ) .
9121607	4	843	Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures , steroids with the 5 alpha , 3 alpha - configuration had comparable or higher protective index values ( TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection ) than clonazepam , indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity .
9121607	5	1243	Steroids with the 5 alpha , 3 alpha - or 5 beta , 3 alpha - configurations also produced a dose - dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by kainic acid ( 32 mg / kg , s . c . ) , but did not completely protect against the seizures .
9121607	6	1474	However , when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose , complete protection from the kainic acid - induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus was obtained .
9121607	7	1663	The steroids also caused a dose - dependent delay in NMDA ( 257 mg / kg , s . c . ) - induced lethality , but did not completely protect against NMDA seizures or lethality .
9121607	8	1823	We conclude that neuroactive steroids are highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine - and kainic acid - induced seizures and status epilepticus in mice , and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of status epilepticus in humans .
9154656	0	0	Hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen gene expression in rats with acute nephrotic syndrome .
9154656	1	96	Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin - angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) .
9154656	2	228	In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) levels of angiotensinogen ( Ao ) were analyzed with the slot - blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues : kidney , heart , brain , and adrenal gland from control , nephrotic , and pair - fed ( PF ) rats .
9154656	3	497	NS was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino - nucleoside ( PAN ) .
9154656	4	571	Although a great urinary excretion and half - normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after PAN injection , when NS was clearly established , hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change .
9154656	5	758	Furthermore , the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6 , nor did its hepatic levels at days 1 , 3 , 5 , or 7 after PAN injection .
9154656	6	928	These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute NS induced by PAN .
9165568	0	0	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with risperidone .
9165568	1	49	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia .
9165568	2	177	Risperidone , a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic , has high serotonin 5 - HT2 receptor blockade and dose - related D2 receptor blockade .
9165568	3	314	The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dosages .
9165568	4	429	With this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms , it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be lowered .
9165568	5	567	A 73 - year - old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone .
9165568	6	664	The syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine .
9165568	7	776	It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome .
9201797	0	0	The attenuating effect of carteolol hydrochloride , a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist , on neuroleptic - induced catalepsy in rats .
9201797	1	125	It is known that beta - adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of akathisia , one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment .
9201797	2	297	Neuroleptic - induced catalepsy , a model of neuroleptic - induced extrapyramidal side effects , was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic - induced akathisia in humans , although neuroleptic - induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic - induced akathisia .
9201797	3	588	Therefore , the effects of carteolol , a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist , on haloperidol - induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden , a muscarinic receptor antagonist .
9201797	4	812	Carteolol , as well as propranolol and biperiden , inhibited the haloperidol - induced catalepsy .
9201797	5	906	The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol , but was weaker than that of biperiden .
9201797	6	1026	Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats .
9201797	7	1158	Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine - induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats .
9201797	8	1291	In addition , carteolol did not evoke 5 - HT1A receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5 - hydroxytryptophan - induced head twitch in rats .
9201797	9	1489	Finally , carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine - induced lethality in rats .
9201797	10	1565	These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol - induced catalepsy via its beta - adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without attenuating neuroleptic - induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity .
9205462	0	0	Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with antecedent tamoxifen use .
9205462	1	76	BACKGROUND : Increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of tamoxifen .
9205462	2	174	Review of the literature reveals an association between tamoxifen use and gynecologic tumors .
9205462	3	268	CASE : A 52 - year - old postmenopausal woman was treated with tamoxifen for stage II estrogen receptor - positive breast carcinoma .
9205462	4	394	Her aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of tamoxifen use .
9205462	5	504	After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases , the patient was found to have a stage Ic granulosa cell tumor of the ovary .
9205462	6	643	CONCLUSION : Patients with tamoxifen - induced liver dysfunction may be at increased risk for granulosa cell tumors because of alterations in tamoxifen metabolism .
9209318	0	0	Lifetime treatment of mice with azidothymidine ( AZT ) produces myelodysplasia .
9209318	1	78	AZT has induced a macrocytic anemia in AIDS patients on long term AZT therapy .
9209318	2	157	It is generally assumed that DNA elongation is stopped by the insertion of AZT into the chain in place of thymidine thus preventing the phosphate hydroxyl linkages and therefore suppresses hemopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in an early stage of differentiation .
9209318	3	426	CBA / Ca male mice started on AZT 0 . 75 mg / ml H2O at 84 days of age and kept on it for 687 days when dosage reduced to 0 . 5 mg / ml H2O for a group , another group removed from AZT to see recovery , and third group remained on 0 . 75 mg .
9209318	4	654	At 687 days mice that had been on 0 . 75 mg had average platelet counts of 2 . 5 x 10 ( 6 ) .
9209318	5	740	Histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such thrombocytopenia showed changes compatible with myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) .
9209318	6	871	A variety of histological patterns was observed .
9209318	7	920	There were two cases of hypocellular myelodysplasia , two cases of hypersegmented myelodysplastic granulocytosis , two cases of hypercellular marrow with abnormal megakaryocytes with bizarre nuclei , one case of megakaryocytic myelosis associated with a hyperplastic marrow , dysmyelopoiesis and a hypocellular marrow and two cases of myelodysplasia with dyserythropoiesis , hemosiderosis and a hypocellular marrow .
9209318	8	1331	Above mentioned AZT incorporation may have induced an ineffective hemopoiesis in the primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells , which is known to be seen commonly in the myelodysplastic syndrome .
921394	0	0	Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of ketamine .
921394	1	99	Effect of ketamine on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery .
921394	2	231	Injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the SA nodal activity by a direct action .
921394	3	373	This depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase .
921394	4	451	Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine - induced tachycardia , while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta - blocking agent into the SA node artery .
921394	5	737	This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the SA node artery .
9214597	0	0	Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen - induced rat pituitary tumors may mediate estrogen - initiated tumor angiogenesis .
9214597	1	186	Estrogens , which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers , can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats .
9214597	2	340	The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction , during estrogen carcinogenesis , are still unknown .
9214597	3	448	To elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats , the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen ( FVIIIRAg ) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor / vascular permeability factor ( VEGF / VPF ) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis .
9214597	4	823	The expression of VEGF receptor ( VEGFR - 2 / Flk - 1 / KDR ) was also examined by immunohistochemistry .
9214597	5	918	The results demonstrated that 17beta - estradiol ( E2 ) induces neovascularization , as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure .
9214597	6	1079	The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF / VPF protein expression in the E2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized ( OVEX ) rats .
9214597	7	1234	VEGF / VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin ( UEA1 ) binding studies , indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non - endothelial cells .
9214597	8	1456	After 15 days of E2 exposure , VEGF / VPF protein expression , in the non - endothelial cell population , sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels .
9214597	9	1613	The function of non - endothelial - derived VEGF is not clear .
9214597	10	1672	Furthermore , immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR - 2 ( flk - 1 / KDR ) , expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of E2 exposure .
9214597	11	1866	These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor ( VEGFR - 2 ) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of estrogen induced tumor angiogenesis in the rat pituitary .
9226773	0	0	Persistent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus following lithium therapy .
9226773	1	69	We report the case of a patient who developed severe hypernatraemic dehydration following a head injury .
9226773	2	174	Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have lithium - induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus , and lithium therapy had been discontinued .
9226773	3	316	He remained thirsty and polyuric despite cessation of lithium and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and vasopressin secretion , with clear evidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus .
9226773	4	539	Lithium induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but polyuria persisted in this patient for ten years after lithium was stopped .
9226773	5	721	We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with lithium - induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus .
9228650	0	0	Effects of NIK - 247 on cholinesterase and scopolamine - induced amnesia .
9228650	1	70	The effects of NIK - 247 on cholinesterase , scopolamine - induced amnesia and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well - known cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and E - 2020 .
9228650	2	267	NIK - 247 , tacrine and E - 2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) in human red blood cells ( IC50s = 1 . 0 x 10 ( - 6 ) , 2 . 9 x 10 ( - 7 ) and 3 . 7 x 10 ( - 8 ) M , respectively ) .
9228650	3	442	In addition , NIK - 247 and tacrine , but not E - 2020 , strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase ( BuChE ) in human serum .
9228650	4	556	All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity .
9228650	5	616	Moreover , the inhibitory effect of NIK - 247 on AChE was reversible .
9228650	6	683	All compounds at 0 . 1 - 1 mg / kg p . o . significantly improved the amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg s . c . ) in rats performing a passive avoidance task .
9228650	7	837	The three compounds at 1 and 3 mg / kg p . o . did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats .
9228650	8	940	These findings suggest that NIK - 247 at a low dose ( 0 . 1 - 1 mg / kg p . o . ) improves scopolamine - induced amnesia but does not affect spontaneous movement .
9228650	9	1088	The findings suggest that NIK - 247 may be a useful drug for the treatment of Alzheimer ' s disease .
9270571	0	0	Potential therapeutic use of the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist , A - 86929 : an acute study in parkinsonian levodopa - primed monkeys .
9270571	1	138	The clinical utility of dopamine ( DA ) D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) is still unclear .
9270571	2	260	The therapeutic use of selective DA D1 receptor agonists such as SKF - 82958 ( 6 - chloro - 7 , 8 - dihydroxy - 3 - allyl - 1 - phenyl - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 - tetrahydro - 1H - 3 - benzaze pine hydrobromide ) and A - 77636 ( [ 1R , 3S ] 3 - [ 1 ' - admantyl ] - 1 - aminomethyl - 3 , 4 - dihydro - 5 , 6 - dihydroxy - 1H - 2 - benzo pyran hydrochloride ) seems limited because of their duration of action , which is too short for SKF - 82958 ( < 1 hr ) and too long for A - 77636 ( > 20 hr , leading to behavioral tolerance ) .
9270571	3	699	We therefore conducted the present acute dose - response study in four 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) - exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit levodopa - induced dyskinesias to evaluate the locomotor and dyskinetic effects on challenge with four doses ( from 0 . 03 to 1 . 0 mg / kg ) of A - 86929 ( [ - ] - [ 5aR , 11bS ] - 4 , 5 , 5a , 6 , 7 , 11b - hexahydro - 2 - propyl - 3 - thia - 5 - + + + azacyclopent - 1 - ena [ c ] phenathrene - 9 - 10 - diol ) , a selective and full DA D1 - like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action .
9270571	4	1207	Levodopa and the DA D2 - like receptor agonist , LY - 171555 ( [ 4aR - trans ] - 4 , 4a , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 8a , 9 - o - dihydro - 5n - propyl - 2H - pyrazo lo - 3 - 4 - quinoline hydrochloride ) were also used for comparison .
9270571	5	1387	Acute administration of A - 86929 was as efficacious in alleviating MPTP - induced parkinsonism as levodopa and LY - 171555 , but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa - induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either LY - 171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa .
9270571	6	1653	Selective stimulation of the DA D1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus ( referred to as the basal ganglia output ) compared with levodopa and selective DA D2 receptor agonist .
9270571	7	1907	Potent DA D1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as A - 86929 ( approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested ) are potential therapeutic tools in PD and merit further attention .
9305828	0	0	Neuropeptide - Y immunoreactivity in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
9305828	1	84	Neuropeptide - Y ( NPY ) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) .
9305828	2	235	This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block seizure - like events following high - frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices .
9305828	3	411	The pilocarpine ( PILO ) model of epilepsy is characterized by an acute period of status epilepticus followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures and related brain damage .
9305828	4	579	We report peroxidase - antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model .
9305828	5	678	PILO - injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals , in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and , in a few cases , within presumed granule cells .
9305828	6	870	NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex , amygdala and sensorimotor areas .
9305828	7	980	In addition , PILO injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY - immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls .
9305828	8	1110	The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression , including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons , are present in the PILO model of TLE .
9305828	9	1303	However , the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined .
9321531	0	0	Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced Parkinson ' s disease .
9321531	1	67	BACKGROUND : Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson ' s disease , but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short - term follow - up .
9321531	2	290	METHODS : Forty patients with Parkinson ' s disease underwent serial , detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ( " off " period ) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ( " on " period ) .
9321531	3	483	All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months ; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year , and 11 at two years .
9321531	4	633	RESULTS : The percent improvements at six months were as follows : off - period score for overall motor function , 28 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 19 to 38 percent ) , with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs ; off - period score for activities of daily living , 29 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 19 to 39 percent ) ; on - period score for contralateral dyskinesias , 82 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 72 to 91 percent ) ; and on - period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias , 44 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 29 to 59 percent ) .
9321531	5	1197	The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off - period parkinsonism , contralateral bradykinesia , and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years .
9321531	6	1377	The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year , and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months .
9321531	7	1530	Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery .
9321531	8	1696	The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated , and there were no significant changes in the use of medication .
9321531	9	1820	CONCLUSIONS : In late - stage Parkinson ' s disease , pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa - induced dyskinesias and off - period disability .
9321531	10	1958	Much of the benefit is sustained at two years , although some improvements , such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms , wane within the first year .
9321531	11	2122	The on - period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy .
9326871	0	0	Clarithromycin - induced ventricular tachycardia .
9326871	1	48	Clarithromycin is a relatively new macrolide antibiotic that offers twice - daily dosing .
9326871	2	136	It differs from erythromycin only in the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 6 .
9326871	3	226	Although the side - effect profile of erythromycin is established , including gastroenteritis and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed - function oxidase metabolism , experience with the newer macrolides is still being recorded .
9326871	4	467	Cardiotoxicity has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of erythromycin but has never been reported with the newer macrolides .
9326871	5	622	We report a case of ventricular dysrhythmias that occurred after six therapeutic doses of clarithromycin .
9326871	6	728	The dysrhythmias resolved after discontinuation of the drug .
9431903	0	0	Effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the sphincter of Oddi spasm evoked by prostigmine - morphine administration .
9431903	1	108	OBJECTIVE : In this study the effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the prostigmine - morphine - induced sphincter of Oddi spasm was evaluated in nine female patients with sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia .
9431903	2	300	METHOD : Sphincter of Oddi spasm was induced by prostigmine - morphine administration ( 0 . 5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously ) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy .
9431903	3	513	The entire procedure was repeated during glyceryl trinitrate infusion ( Nitrolingual 1 microg / kg / min for 120 min ) .
9431903	4	627	RESULTS : Prostigmine - morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity ( Tmax ) over the hepatic hilum ( HH : 34 . 33 + / - 5 . 05 vs . 22 . 77 + / - 3 . 26 ) and the common bile duct ( CBD : 60 . 44 + / - 5 . 99 vs . 40 . 0 + / - 2 . 88 ) and in the half - time of excretion ( T1 / 2 ) over the liver parenchyma ( LP : 120 . 04 + / - 16 . 01 vs . 27 . 37 + / - 2 . 19 ) , HH ( 117 . 61 + / - 14 . 71 vs . 31 . 85 + / - 3 . 99 ) and CBD ( 158 . 11 + / - 9 . 18 vs . 40 . 1 + / - 6 . 24 ) , indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi .
9431903	5	1125	Glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely normalized the prostigmine - morphine - induced alterations in these quantitative parameters ( TmaX over the LP : 11 . 33 + / - 1 . 13 ; over the HH : 18 . 88 + / - 1 . 48 ; and over the CBD : 36 . 22 + / - 1 . 92 ; and T1 / 2 over the LP : 28 . 21 + / - 1 . 83 ; over the HH : 33 . 42 + / - 3 . 10 ; and over the CBD : 41 . 66 + / - 6 . 33 ) , suggesting an effective sphincter - relaxing effect of glyceryl trinitrate .
9431903	6	1528	CONCLUSION : These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine - induced sphincter of Oddi spasm in humans .
9431903	7	1684	Since glyceryl trinitrate is able to overcome even the drastic effect of morphine , it might be of relevance in the treatment of sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia .
950631	0	0	Immunopathology of penicillamine - induced glomerular disease .
950631	1	61	Four patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed heavy proteinuria after five to 12 months of treatment with D - penicillamine .
950631	2	188	Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase , or no departure from normal .
950631	3	341	Electron microscopy , however , revealed subepithelial electron - dense deposits , fusion of epithelial cell foot processes , and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity .
950631	4	507	Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3 .
950631	5	598	The findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis , differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early - acting complement components C1q and C4 .
950631	6	790	It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway .
9514561	0	0	Experimental cranial pain elicited by capsaicin : a PET study .
9514561	1	62	Using a positron emission tomography ( PET ) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state , but not in the headache free interval .
9514561	2	276	It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called ' migraine generator ' .
9514561	3	418	To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers , using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients .
9514561	4	586	A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve .
9514561	5	752	Increases of regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) were found bilaterally in the insula , in the anterior cingulate cortex , the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum .
9514561	6	913	Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state .
9514561	7	1087	The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however , suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such , rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache .
9523850	0	0	Value of methylprednisolone in prevention of the arthralgia - myalgia syndrome associated with the total dose infusion of iron dextran : a double blind randomized trial .
9523850	1	167	The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion ( TDI ) of iron dextran has been well documented .
9523850	2	262	In 40 % of treated patients , an arthralgia - myalgia syndrome develops .
9523850	3	331	The purpose of this randomized , double - blind , prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous ( i . v . ) administration of methylprednisolone ( MP ) prevents this complication .
9523850	4	511	Sixty - five patients , 34 women and 31 men , ages 36 to 80 years , received either normal saline before and after TDI ( group 1 ) , 125 mg i . v . MP before and saline after TDI ( group 2 ) , or 125 mg i . v . MP before and after TDI ( group 3 ) .
9523850	5	740	Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity .
9523850	6	838	Fifty - eight percent of group 1 patients , 33 % of group 2 , and 26 % of group 3 had reactions to TDI .
9523850	7	936	The severity of reactions ( minimal , mild , and moderate , respectively ) was as follows : group 1 - - 6 , 6 , and 2 ; group 2 - - 1 , 5 , and 0 ; group 3 - - 5 , 1 , and 0 .
9523850	8	1088	Data were analyzed by the two - sided Fisher ' s exact test using 95 % confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf .
9523850	9	1208	These data demonstrate that administration of MP before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the arthralgia - myalgia syndrome .
9523850	10	1349	We conclude that 125 mg i . v . MP should be given routinely before and after TDI of iron dextran .
9545159	0	0	Prolongation of the QT interval related to cisapride - diltiazem interaction .
9545159	1	76	Cisapride , a cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) substrate , is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders .
9545159	2	208	Prolongation of QT interval , torsades de pointes , and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents , but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors .
9545159	3	419	A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45 - year - old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem , an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 , for hypertension .
9545159	4	621	The patient was in near syncope and had QT - interval prolongation .
9545159	5	687	After discontinuing cisapride , the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur .
9545159	6	781	We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , including diltiazem .
9549528	0	0	Cortical motor overactivation in parkinsonian patients with L - dopa - induced peak - dose dyskinesia .
9549528	1	97	We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) changes induced by the execution of a finger - to - thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on L - dopa medication , the first one without L - dopa induced dyskinesia ( n = 23 ) and the other with moderate peak - dose dyskinesia ( n = 15 ) , and of a group of 14 normal subjects .
9549528	2	490	Single photon emission tomography with i . v . 133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes .
9549528	3	578	The dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non - dyskinetic parkinsonian patients , with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi - and contralateral primary motor areas .
9549528	4	871	These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement , like L - dopa - induced peak dose dyskinesia , is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop .
9564988	0	0	Open - label assessment of levofloxacin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in adults .
9564988	1	96	PURPOSE : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin ( 500 mg orally once daily for 10 to 14 days ) in treating adult outpatients with acute bacterial sinusitis .
9564988	2	264	PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers .
9564988	3	347	All patients had a pre - therapy Gram ' s stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy .
9564988	4	468	Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results .
9564988	5	587	Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre - therapy pathogen ( s ) .
9564988	6	713	RESULTS : The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Moraxella catarrhalis .
9564988	7	853	Of 300 clinically evaluable patients , 175 ( 58 % ) were cured and 90 ( 30 % ) were improved at the post - therapy evaluation , resulting in a clinical success rate of 88 % .
9564988	8	1016	Thirty - five patients ( 12 % ) clinically failed treatment .
9564988	9	1072	The microbiologic eradication rate ( presumed plus documented ) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92 % .
9564988	10	1190	Microbiologic eradication rates ( presumed plus documented ) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93 % ( M . catarrhalis ) to 100 % ( S . pneumoniae ) at the post - therapy visit .
9564988	11	1362	All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post - therapy returned for a long - term follow - up visit ; 243 ( 92 % ) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy ; and 21 ( 8 % ) had a relapse of symptoms .
9564988	12	1570	Adverse events considered to be related to levofloxacin administration were reported by 29 patients ( 9 % ) .
9564988	13	1676	The most common drug - related adverse events were diarrhea , flatulence , and nausea ; most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity .
9564988	14	1814	CONCLUSION : The results of this study indicate that levofloxacin 500 mg once daily is an effective and safe treatment for acute bacterial sinusitis .
9579567	0	0	Iatrogenic risks of endometrial carcinoma after treatment for breast cancer in a large French case - control study .
9579567	1	114	F d ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer ( FNCLCC ) .
9579567	2	185	Since tamoxifen is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer , its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined .
9579567	3	365	We have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case - control study .
9579567	4	527	Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer ( n = 135 ) and 467 controls matched for age , year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included .
9579567	5	732	Women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not ( crude relative risk = 4 . 9 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .
9579567	6	897	Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment ( p = 0 . 0001 ) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received ( p = 0 . 0001 ) , irrespective of the daily dose .
9579567	7	1094	Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk ( crude relative risk = 7 . 8 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .
9579567	8	1202	After adjusting for confounding factors , the risk was higher for tamoxifen users ( p = 0 . 0012 ) , treatment for more than 3 years ( all p < 0 . 03 ) and pelvic radiotherapy ( p = 0 . 012 ) .
9579567	9	1381	Women who had endometrial cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment .
9579567	10	1560	Our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial cancer , particularly when used as currently proposed for breast cancer prevention .
9579567	11	1705	Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with breast cancer .
9579567	12	1794	Endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prognosis .
9579567	13	1879	Women who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment .
9579567	14	1999	A long - term evaluation of the risk - benefit ratio of tamoxifen as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted .
9630698	0	0	Contribution of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in rostral and intermediate - caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rats .
9630698	1	150	The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone .
9630698	2	298	Muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method , which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance ( MMG ) of the rat ' s hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity ( EMG ) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint : gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior .
9630698	3	631	Muscle rigidity was induced by haloperidol ( 2 . 5 mg / kg i . p . ) . 5 , 7 - dichlorokynurenic acid ( 5 , 7 - DCKA ) , a selective glycine site antagonist , injected in doses of 2 . 5 and 4 . 5 microg / 0 . 5 microl bilaterally , into the rostral region of the striatum , decreased both the haloperidol - induced muscle rigidity ( MMG ) and the enhanced electromyographic activity ( EMG ) . 5 , 7 - DCKA injected bilaterally in a dose of 4 . 5 microg / 0 . 5 microl into the intermediate - caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with haloperidol had no effect on the muscle tone .
9630698	4	1176	The present results suggest that blockade of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the antiparkinsonian action of this drug .
9636837	0	0	Carboplatin toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat .
9636837	1	71	BACKGROUND : The most striking of carboplatin ' s advantages ( CBDCA ) over cisplatin ( CDDP ) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects .
9636837	2	211	However , the use of CBDCA higher - intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage .
9636837	3	422	MATERIALS AND METHODS : Two different schedules of CBDCA administration ( 10 mg / kg and 15 mg / kg i . p . twice a week for nine times ) were evaluated in Wistar rats .
9636837	4	581	Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral ( tail - flick test ) , neurophysiological ( nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve ) , morphological , morphometrical and analytical effects .
9636837	5	762	RESULTS : CBDCA administration induced dose - dependent peripheral neurotoxicity .
9636837	6	841	Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired , particularly after the high - dose treatment .
9636837	7	972	The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and , to a lesser extent , satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP , mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons .
9636837	8	1177	Moreover , significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment .
9636837	9	1294	CONCLUSIONS : CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model , and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism .
9636837	10	1526	This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of CBDCA on the peripheral nervous system .
9669632	0	0	Effects of cisapride on symptoms and postcibal small - bowel motor function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome .
9669632	1	117	BACKGROUND : Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of abdominal pain and discomfort and may be related to disordered gastrointestinal motility .
9669632	2	265	Our aim was to assess the effects of long - term treatment with a prokinetic agent , cisapride , on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) .
9669632	3	443	METHODS : Thirty - eight patients with IBS ( constipation - predominant , n = 17 ; diarrhoea - predominant , n = 21 ) underwent 24 - h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week ' s treatment [ cisapride , 5 mg three times daily ( n = 19 ) or placebo ( n = 19 ) ] .
9669632	4	696	RESULTS : In diarrhoea - predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the cisapride and placebo groups .
9669632	5	850	In cisapride - treated diarrhoea - predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher ( 29 . 3 + / - 3 . 2 versus 24 . 9 + / - 2 . 6 mm Hg , cisapride versus placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; pretreatment , 25 . 7 + / - 6 . 0 mm Hg ) , the mean contraction duration longer ( 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 2 versus 3 . 0 + / - 0 . 2 sec , cisapride versus placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; pretreatment , 3 . 1 + / - 0 . 5 sec ) , and the mean contraction frequency lower ( 2 . 0 + / - 0 . 2 versus 2 . 5 + / - 0 . 4 cont . / min , cisapride versus placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; pretreatment , 2 . 5 + / - 1 . 1 cont . / min ] than patients treated with placebo .
9669632	6	1397	No significant differences in jejunal motility were found in the constipation - predominant IBS group .
9669632	7	1498	Symptoms were assessed by using a visual analogue scale before and after treatment .
9669632	8	1582	Symptom scores relating to the severity of constipation were lower in cisapride - treated constipation - predominant IBS patients [ score , 54 + / - 5 versus 67 + / - 14 mm , cisapride versus placebo ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; pretreatment , 62 + / - 19 mm ] .
9669632	9	1812	Diarrhoea - predominant IBS patients had a higher pain score after cisapride therapy [ score , 55 + / - 15 versus 34 + / - 12 mm , cisapride versus placebo ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; pretreatment , 67 + / - 19 mm ] .
9669632	10	2000	CONCLUSION : Cisapride affects jejunal contraction characteristics and some symptoms in IBS .
9672273	0	0	Prevention of breast cancer with tamoxifen : preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women .
9672273	1	128	Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study .
9672273	2	164	BACKGROUND : Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer , although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer .
9672273	3	321	Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive .
9672273	4	406	METHODS : In October , 1992 , we started a double - blind placebo - controlled , randomised trial of tamoxifen in women ( mainly in Italy ) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy .
9672273	5	599	Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo , both orally for 5 years .
9672273	6	693	The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years ' follow - up .
9672273	7	771	In June , 1997 , the trialists and the data - monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study .
9672273	8	929	Recruitment ended on July 11 , 1997 , and the study will continue as planned .
9672273	9	1005	The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer .
9672273	10	1080	This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention - to - treat .
9672273	11	1146	FINDINGS : 5408 women were randomised ; participating women have a median follow - up of 46 months for major endpoints . 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far ; there have been no deaths from breast cancer .
9672273	12	1351	There is no difference in breast - cancer frequency between the placebo ( 22 cases ) and tamoxifen ( 19 ) arms .
9672273	13	1457	There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone - replacement therapy during the trial : among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo , we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen .
9672273	14	1772	Compared with the placebo group , there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen .
9672273	15	1917	INTERPRETATION : Although this preliminary analysis has low power , in this cohort of women at low - to - normal risk of breast cancer , the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent .
9672273	16	2116	Women using hormone - replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen .
9672273	17	2204	There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study .
9672273	18	2276	It is essential to continue follow - up to quantify the long - term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy .
9758264	0	0	Epileptogenic activity of folic acid after drug induces SLE ( folic acid and epilepsy )
9758264	1	86	OBJECTIVE : To study the effect of folic acid - containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth defects and epilepsy - related side effects .
9758264	2	312	STUDY DESIGN : First a randomised trial , later periconception care including in total 12225 females .
9758264	3	412	RESULTS : Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid ( 0 . 8 mg ) - containing multivitamin supplementation , no one developed epilepsy - related side effects during the periconception period .
9758264	4	607	One epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate .
9758264	5	674	Another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin .
9758264	6	787	This 22 - year - old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic acid ( 1 mg ) - containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation .
9758264	7	943	She developed status epilepticus and later symptoms of systemic lupus erythematodes .
9758264	8	1028	Her pregnancy ended with stillbirth .
9758264	9	1065	CONCLUSIONS : The epileptic pregnant patient ' s autoimmune disease ( probably drug - induced lupus ) could damage the blood - brain barrier , therefore the therapeutic dose ( > or = 1 mg ) of folic acid triggered a cluster of seizures .
9758264	10	1289	Physiological dose ( < 1 mg ) of folic acid both in healthy and 60 epileptic women , all without any autoimmune disease , did not increase the risk for epileptic seizures .
9799166	0	0	Stroke and cocaine or amphetamine use .
9799166	1	39	The association of cocaine and amphetamine use with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke is based almost solely on data from case series .
9799166	2	172	The limited number of epidemiologic studies of stroke and use of cocaine and / or amphetamine have been done in settings that serve mostly the poor and / or minorities .
9799166	3	337	This case - control study was conducted in the defined population comprising members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern and Southern California .
9799166	4	478	We attempted to identify all incident strokes in women ages 15 - 44 years during a 3 - year period using hospital admission and discharge records , emergency department logs , and payment requests for out - of - plan hospitalizations .
9799166	5	703	We selected controls , matched on age and facility of usual care , at random from healthy members of the health plan .
9799166	6	819	We obtained information in face - to - face interviews .
9799166	7	871	There were 347 confirmed stroke cases and 1 , 021 controls .

982002	0	0	Acute renal failure subsequent to the administration of rifampicin .
982002	1	68	A follow - up study of cases reported earlier .
982002	2	113	A clinical presentation is made of a 2 - 3 year follow - up of six cases of acute renal failure that have been reported earlier .
982002	3	238	The patients had developed transient renal failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin .
982002	4	342	The stage of olig - anuria lasted for 1 - 3 weeks , and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis .
982002	5	444	Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow - up period .
982002	6	522	The four patients re - examined were clinically cured .
982002	7	575	Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce .
982002	8	661	Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied .
982002	9	739	Renal function was normal .
982002	10	766	In three cases the excretion at 131I - hippuran renography was slightly slowed .
982002	11	844	Although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic , evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded .
9848575	0	0	Chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative ( SM - 5887 ) on normal heart and doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs .
9848575	1	143	This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM - 5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM - 5887 on low - grade cardiotoxicity pre - induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs .
9848575	2	345	In the chronic treatment , beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks , either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) or SM - 5887 ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) .
9848575	3	515	The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing .
9848575	4	577	Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes , decrease of blood pressure and high - grade histopathological cardiomyopathy , while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM - 5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG , blood pressure and histopathological examinations .
9848575	5	922	To examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of SM - 5887 , low - grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) .
9848575	6	1078	Nine weeks after pre - treatment , dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) or SM - 5887 ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) once every 3 weeks .
9848575	7	1216	The low - grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment .
9848575	8	1305	On the contrary , the SM - 5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy .
9848575	9	1390	In conclusion , SM - 5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in dogs .
9867728	0	0	Risk for valvular heart disease among users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before use of medication .
9867728	1	137	BACKGROUND : Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30 % to 38 % of users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine had valvular disease , these drugs were withdrawn from the market .
9867728	2	339	OBJECTIVE : To determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications .
9867728	3	539	DESIGN : Cohort study .
9867728	4	561	SETTING : Academic primary care practices .
9867728	5	603	PATIENTS : 46 patients who used fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy .
9867728	6	735	MEASUREMENTS : Follow - up echocardiography .
9867728	7	777	The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy , defined as progression of either aortic or mitral regurgitation by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U . S . Food and Drug Administration criteria ( at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation ) .
9867728	8	1066	RESULTS : Two patients ( 4 . 3 % [ 95 % CI , 0 . 6 % to 14 . 8 % ] ) receiving fenfluramine - phentermine developed valvular heart disease .
9867728	9	1188	One had baseline bicuspid aortic valve and mild aortic regurgitation that progressed to moderate regurgitation .
9867728	10	1300	The second patient developed new moderate aortic insufficiency .
9867728	11	1364	CONCLUSION : Users of diet medications are at risk for valvular heart disease .
9867728	12	1442	However , the incidence may be lower than that reported previously .
9875685	0	0	Therapeutic drug monitoring of tobramycin : once - daily versus twice - daily dosage schedules .
9875685	1	91	OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen ( once - daily vs . twice - daily ) of tobramicyn on steady - state serum concentrations and toxicity .
9875685	2	237	MATERIALS AND METHODS : Patients undergoing treatment with i . v . tobramycin ( 4 mg / kg / day ) were randomised to two groups .
9875685	3	356	Group OD ( n = 22 ) received a once - daily dose of tobramycin and group TD ( n = 21 ) received the same dose divided into two doses daily .
9875685	4	490	Tobramycin serum concentrations ( peak and trough ) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay .
9875685	5	588	The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before , during and immediately after treatment .
9875685	6	700	RESULTS : The two groups were comparable with respect to sex , age , body weight and renal function .
9875685	7	798	No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose , duration of treatment , or cumulative dose .
9875685	8	913	Trough concentrations were < 2 g / ml in the two groups ( 100 % ) .
9875685	9	975	Peak concentrations were > 6 microg / ml in 100 % of the OD group and in 67 % of the TD group ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
9875685	10	1076	Mean peak concentrations were markedly different : 11 . 00 + / - 2 . 89 microg / ml in OD vs . 6 . 53 + / - 1 . 45 microg / ml in TD ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
9875685	11	1198	The pharmacokinetics parameters were : Ke , ( 0 . 15 + / - 0 . 03 / h in OD vs . 0 . 24 + / - 0 . 06 / h in TD ) , t1 / 2 , ( 4 . 95 + / - 1 . 41 h in OD vs . 3 . 07 + / - 0 . 71 h in TD ) , Vd ( 0 . 35 + / - 0 . 11 l / kg in OD vs . 0 . 33 + / - 0 . 09 l / kg in TD ) , Cl ( 0 . 86 + / - 0 . 29 ml / min / kg in OD vs . 1 . 28 + / - 0 . 33 ml / min / kg in TD ) .
9875685	12	1462	Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73 % of patients in OD versus 57 % of patients in TD , without evidence of nephrotoxicity .
9875685	13	1593	In TD group , three patients developed decreased auditory function , of which one presented with an auditory loss of - 30 dB , whereas in the OD group only one patient presented decreased auditory function .
9875685	14	1796	CONCLUSION : This small study suggests that a once - daily dosing regimen of tobramycin is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice - daily regimen .
9875685	15	1978	Using a single - dose therapy , peak concentration determination is not necessary , only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg / ml .
9915601	0	0	Enhanced bradycardia induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid .
9915601	1	97	High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia , an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) .
9915601	2	319	In the present study , the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose - urethane .
9915601	3	498	Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol , pindolol , labetalol and atenolol , as well as after clonidine , but not after hexamethonium or carbachol .
9915601	4	667	Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised .
9915601	5	762	These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone .
9915601	6	881	Such interference could be exerted centrally , possibly at the nucleus ambiguus , or peripherally at the sinus node .
9952311	0	0	Structural and functional impairment of mitochondria in adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy in mice : suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression .
9952311	1	155	The use of adriamycin ( ADR ) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity .
9952311	2	270	Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR ' s action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb - c mice i . p . treated with ADR for several weeks .
9952311	3	549	At various times during treatment , the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy .
9952311	4	714	In parallel , total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady - state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII , COXIII , and COXIV genes .
9952311	5	935	Similarly , samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies .
9952311	6	1037	Our results indicated that 1 ) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia , extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS ) , and failure of QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose ) ; 2 ) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling , fusion , dissolution , and / or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment .
9952311	7	1440	Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue ; and 3 ) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined , only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment , mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver .
9952311	8	1673	Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40 % of heart muscle by weight , we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment .
